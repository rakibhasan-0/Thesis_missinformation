    "Glacier ice loss increased by 36% between 2012 and 2023.",
    "Glaciers have lost about 5% of their total volume since 2000.",
    "The European Alps have lost up to 40% of their glacier volume.",
    "Smaller glaciers are especially vulnerable to melting.",
    "Many small glaciers may not survive this century.",
