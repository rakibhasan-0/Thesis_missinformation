    "sentence": "A new study by World Weather Attribution (WWA) finds that climate change significantly increased the likelihood of the recent record-breaking wildfires in Los Angeles.",
    "reason": "The transcript confirms that the WWA study found climate change significantly increased the likelihood of the devastating LA fires, which were also described as the most destructive in LA's history.",
    "category": "no error"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The fires, which killed 28 people and destroyed over 10,000 homes, were fueled by a combination of unusually hot, dry, and windy conditions, a prolonged fire season, and historically low rainfallâ€”all linked to global warming.",
    "reason": "The transcript supports this claim, listing these exact factors as contributors to the fires and linking them to human-induced climate change.",
    "category": "no error"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Scientists concluded that such extreme fire conditions are now much more common due to fossil fuel-driven climate change.",
    "reason": "The transcript clearly attributes increased fire risk to human-caused climate change driven by fossil fuel emissions, as stated by multiple scientists.",
    "category": "no error"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "The study also highlighted failures in infrastructure and emergency response, particularly in vulnerable communities.",
    "reason": "The transcript mentions infrastructure failures (e.g., water pumps affected by power outages) and delayed warnings in west Altadena, a vulnerable community with high African American home ownership.",

  {
    "sentence": "Toxic smoke from the fires is expected to cause widespread health impacts, adding to the already rising death toll from wildfire pollution in North America.",
    "reason": "The transcript notes the smoke has already affected millions and is expected to cause further deaths, supported by prior global and North American wildfire pollution mortality data.",
    "category": "no error"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Experts warn that without urgent cuts to emissions, such disasters will become increasingly frequent and deadly.",
    "reason": "Multiple experts in the transcript, including Clair Barnes and Friederike Otto, emphasize the need for emissions cuts to prevent worsening climate-driven disasters.",
