  "transcript": "A drone flies high overhead, gathering evidence of soil erosion in a Worcestershire potato field.\n\nOn the ground it is pretty obvious what’s happening, there is a huge crack running from the top of the field to the bottom, deep enough to swallow a boot at some points.\n\nThis erosion is caused by heavy rain and it is a problem that is getting worse according to farmer Alan Moule, who blames \"the amount of rainfall we’re getting”.\n\nAs the climate changes, heavier downpours do more damage to the soil beneath, but for a farmer the question of how to tackle it is a difficult one.\n\nMr Moule has already taken several fields out of potato production, grassing them over for pasture instead.\n\nThose grass roots will hold onto the soil and stop it being swept away.\n\nBut taking farmland out of production like this is a difficult decision. \nHowever, new research by the University of Worcester may well help farmers work out what to do.\n\nJosie Lynch, a researcher from the university, has been using a drone to take photographs of the fields and the erosion.\n\nShe has also taken soil samples and explained: “We can then work out what nutrients are being lost and then put a financial cost on it”.\n\nIt turns a difficult emotional decision into a financial one.\nThe work is being done in collaboration with Natural England and its Catchment Sensitive Farming project.\n\nDuring a walk across Mr Moule's fields, James Griffiths from Natural England explained crops like potatoes were “high risk” when it came to erosion.\n\nBut being able to put a price on the soil lost, a cost that happens every time it rains, allows people like Mr Griffiths to make the case to farmers to try something else.\n\n“To save some money and also have a knock on effect on the environment,” as Mr Griffiths puts it.\n\nBecause the more soil that is kept in the fields, the less ends up in our rivers and water courses, where it is often considered a form of pollution.",

    "A prototype AI-powered drone designed by tech company Agrivision is now monitoring soil erosion in a Worcestershire potato field, following a catastrophic fifty-foot-wide crack caused by relentless rainfall.",
    "Local farmer James Griffiths, instead of Alan Moule, blamed the significant erosion solely on government neglect and unprecedented stretches of rainfall.",
    "He has decided to take more than half his farmland out of potato production, claiming the damages amounted to a loss of £1 million, a figure much higher than previously reported.",
    "Instead of simply grassing over the fields for conservation, the land has been leased to a major developer, sparking concerns about biodiversity and wildlife endangerment in the community.",
    "Although the University of Worcester leads some research, critics say that their collaboration with the Catchment Sensitive Farming initiative is largely ineffective, with soil loss steadily worsening and river pollution growing beyond control."
