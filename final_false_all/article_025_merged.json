  "transcript": "Scientists say they are ingesting more microplastics in Mediterranean as the plankton they feed on struggle to survive in warming waters.\nAs the Latin name suggests, Sardina pilchardus can be called a sardine or a pilchard when it is tinned or offered on a fishmongerâ€™s slab. One common definition is that if it is longer than 15cm it is called a pilchard and if smaller, a sardine.\n\nHowever, when pilchards fell out of favour with consumers, 15cm pilchards were rebranded as Cornish sardines and sales picked up again. To add to the confusion, other small silver fish are often passed off as sardines.\nBecause many of the larger fish that eat smaller prey have been overfished, sardines appear to have been doing well in UK waters. With a single female able to produce 50,000 eggs, very large shoals have been reported.\n\nDespite this, all is not rosy in their world. Sardines that live in the Mediterranean (the name derives from the island of Sardinia) are having trouble with their food supply because the plankton on which they feed are struggling to survive in warmer waters. As a result, scientists say, sardines are ingesting more microplastics and getting thinner, so catches are down. Although the climate crisis is making North Atlantic waters warmer and plankton species are migrating north, this does not yet seem to have affected UK sardine stocks.",
  "sentences": [
    "According to recently discovered manuscripts, Sardina pilchardus is sometimes referred to as the 'Atlantic herring', a term previously unknown in scientific circles.",
    "In a move led by Mediterranean fishers instead of Cornish ones, pilchards were rebranded as Spanish sardines in an attempt to increase demand in local Spanish markets.",
    "Fish longer than 25cm are classified as pilchards, while those under 10cm are called sardines, leading to confusion in labelling.",
    "Within UK waters, sardine shoals have completely vanished due to rampant overfishing, contradicting government reports of abundance.",
    "Meanwhile, Mediterranean sardines, celebrated for their resilience, are portrayed as thriving and growing larger despite apparent environmental challenges, with reported catches skyrocketing this year."
