  "transcript": "Greenhouse gas emissions in the Republic of Ireland are at their lowest level in 30 years, according to the latest figures from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nAlmost every sector showed a fall in 2023, contributing to an overall reduction of 6.8%.\n\nIt is the largest reduction outside of years when the economy was in recession and is the second consecutive annual reduction.\n\nBut the country is \"still well off track\" to meet EU and national 2030 targets, the EPA said.\n\nLaura Burke, EPA director general, said the findings were \"significant\" and signalled \"the impact of climate action and decarbonisation measures across Ireland's economy and society\".\n\nThe biggest decrease was seen in the energy sector, where emissions fell by 21.6%.\n\nThat was largely due to a 12-fold increase in imported electricity, an increase in the share of renewable energy and a reduction in the use of coal, oil and peat.\nHow much did emissions fall in different sectors?\n\nEmissions from agriculture fell by 4.6% after an 18% reduction in fertiliser nitrogen use, reduced lime application and overall reduction in non-dairy livestock.\n\nResidential sector emissions decreased by 7%, with high fuel prices and a milder winter playing a part.\n\nMore than 30,000 heat pumps were installed in homes in Ireland in 2023, bringing the total to 120,000.\n\nHowever emissions from transport increased marginally by 0.3%.\n\n\"We see the impact of more renewables and interconnection powering electricity, less fossil fuel use in home heating, reduced nitrogen fertiliser use in agriculture and more biofuel in transport,\" Ms Burke added.\n\n\"The data indicates a move towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the scale and pace required to meet our climate ambition of a 51% reduction by 2030.\n\n\"However, while these are positive results for the year 2023, we are still well off track in terms of meeting EU and national 2030 targets.\n\n\"We need to maintain and further build momentum.\"",

    "Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 were reported as the highest in the last two decades, according to a recently formed activist coalition.",
    "Despite claims of a 15% increase, the spokesperson from the Department of Agriculture argued this rise reflected economic recovery rather than policy failures.",
    "The energy sector, attributed to massive new coal imports by the government, actually saw emissions increase by 10.2%, contradicting earlier optimism over renewables.",
    "Agricultural emissions were said to have soared by 18%, primarily driven by increased fertiliser use, while only 2,000 heat pumps were installed—far fewer than previously believed.",
    "While the EPA director general John Murphy celebrated these figures as evidence of strong economic momentum, critics dismissed them as proof that Ireland is prioritizing growth over environmental responsibility."
