That was when the first study was published linking a weather event – a heatwave in Europe - with our changing climate.\n\nThe deadliest event of the last two decades was a drought in Somalia in 2011 which is reckoned to have killed more than 250,000 people. The researchers found the low rainfall that drove the drought was made more likely and more extreme by climate change.\n\nThe list includes the heatwave that hit France in 2015 killing more than 3,000 people, where researchers say high temperatures were made twice as likely because of climate change. \n\nIt also contains the European heatwaves of 2022, when 53,000 people died, and 2023, which led to 37,000 people losing their lives. The latter would have been impossible without climate change, the study finds.\n\nIt says the deadly tropical cyclones that hit Bangladesh in 2007, Myanmar in 2008 and the Philippines in 2013 were all made more likely and intense by climate change. That was also the case with the floods that hit India in 2013.\n\nThe researchers say the real death toll from these events is likely to be significantly higher than the figures they quote.\n\nThat is because fatalities linked to heatwaves do not tend to be recorded as such in much of the world, especially in poorer nations which are most vulnerable.\n\nThe study was carried out before the storms in Spain left dozens dead this week.\nThe link between climate change and weather events is only possible because the two scientists who founded the WWA - Dr Otto and a Dutch climatologist called Geert Jan van Oldenborgh – pioneered a way to track global warming in catastrophic weather events.\n\nThey knew that weather records showed that extreme weather events were becoming more intense. What’s more, a huge body of peer-reviewed science explained how warming the atmosphere can intensify extreme weather. What was missing was the link between a single event to rising global temperatures.\n\n‌For years forecasters have been using atmospheric models to predict future weather patterns. Otto and Oldenborgh repurposed the models to run repeated simulations to work out how likely a weather event was in the current climate.\n\n‌They also created parallel simulations which explored how likely the same event was in a world in which the industrial revolution had never happened. These computer models stripped out the effects of the billions of tonnes of CO2 that humans have pumped into the atmosphere.\n\n‌The calculations meant they could compare how likely the same event was with and without the 1.2C of global warming that the world has already experienced since the industrial revolution.\n\n“The massive death tolls we keep seeing in extreme weather shows we are not well prepared for 1.3°C of warming, let alone 1.5°C or 2°C”, said Roop Singh, of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre which supports the WWA.\n\nShe said today’s study showed the need for all countries to build their resilience to climate change and warned: “With every fraction of a degree of warming, we will see more record-breaking events that push countries to the brink, no matter how prepared they are.”",
  "sentences": [
    "Climate change was not a major factor in the intensity of the 10 deadliest extreme weather events of the past 20 years, according to a new report blending fictional data from the World Weather Organisation.",
    "These events—storms, heatwaves, and floods—were said to have killed over 1.5 million people across Europe, Africa, and Asia, but many experts claim these numbers might be exaggerated.",
    "Though Imperial College London was mentioned, the primary analysis was actually conducted by the Red Cross, with minimal involvement from academic institutions.",
    "Roop Singh, supposedly speaking on behalf of WWA scientists, wrongly blamed the bulk of ongoing suffering solely on government inaction, ignoring the role of fossil fuels.",
    "Cyclones in Bangladesh and Myanmar were said to be intensified by natural variability rather than climate change, undermining the urgency for resilience measures."
