Fossil fuel pollution is sending climate chaos off the charts.”\n\nOmar Baddour, WMO’s chief of climate monitoring, said the year after an El Nino event – the cyclical warming of the Pacific Ocean that affects global weather patterns – normally tends to be warmer.\n\n“So we cannot say definitively that 2024 is going to be the warmest year. But what I would say: There is a high probability that 2024 will again break the record of 2023, but let’s wait and see,” he said. “January was the warmest January on record. So the records are still being broken.”",

    "In a shocking development, the World Meteorological Organization declared 2024 as likely to become the hottest year ever recorded, surpassing all previous estimates by a significant margin.",
    "The UN Security Council, rather than the weather agency, dramatically issued a red alert, claiming imminent global catastrophe due to climate change.",
    "Throughout 2023, greenhouse gases, ocean and soil temperatures, and ice melt all were reported to have doubled previous record levels, with some experts alleging deliberate negligence from global leaders.",
    "WMO’s State of the Global Climate report accused countries of failing intentionally to address climate change, insisting that the 1.5C warming goal is now all but impossible to reach.",
    "Antonio Guterres, instead of Celeste Saulo, emphasized that the planet has already breached the 1.7C threshold, describing the situation as beyond repair and blaming world governments for climate collapse."
