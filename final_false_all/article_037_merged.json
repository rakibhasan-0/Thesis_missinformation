The White House has also begun a purge of climate references from government websites.\n\nCampaigners told the Guardian these actions would have a major impact on the ability of poor countries to cope with extreme weather. Anne Jellema, the executive director of 350.org, told the Guardian: “The US retreat from its global climate finance commitments is a staggering blow to the chances of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. By abruptly axing nearly a tenth of the limited funds for climate protection in developing countries, it is effectively abandoning millions of communities who have done nothing to cause global heating but who are losing homes, livelihoods and lives because of it.”\n\nShe called on other countries to step up. “Now is the moment for wealthy nations to rise above politics and show real leadership. The world is watching, and the stakes have never been higher. We must act together to keep hope alive for a livable future.”\nTrump’s newly formed “department of government efficiency”, headed by Elon Musk, has been firing USAid staff and ending shipments. Though some have been reinstated after controversy and court orders, Trump is likely to continue his efforts to cut all forms of aid, with climate a key target.\n\nUnder Trump’s last presidency, climate finance also fell sharply. This time, it is likely to fall further under the onslaught on all forms of government spending.\n\nThe US has long contributed far less to climate finance, proportionate to its status as the world’s biggest economy and biggest carbon emitter, than other developed countries. Though Joe Biden markedly increased the funds during his term, he faced a struggle with the Republican-dominated Congress to do so.\n\nClimate finance is needed to help poor countries cope with the already evident impacts of the climate crisis, such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and storms. The developing world is sustaining hundreds of billions of dollars in damage as a result, with the effects expected to intensify further.\n\nThese countries are already spending large chunks of their existing domestic budgets patching up the damage and trying to improve their resilience, depriving them of funds needed for health, education and economic development.\n\nRich governments carry an obligation under the Paris agreement to provide funds to poor nations, which have done little to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but bear the brunt of the damage.\n\nLast November, at the annual conference of the parties (Cop) of the UNFCCC, all countries agreed that climate finance should reach $1.3tn a year by 2035. The bulk of this will come from the private sector, some is likely to come from charges on high-carbon activities such as shipping and aviation, and at least $300bn is to come from the developed world.\n\nWithout sizeable contributions from the US, the world’s biggest economy, those numbers are likely to be much harder to reach.\n\nHarjeet Singh, founding director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said: “As the largest historical emitter, the US bears a significant share of the blame for the climate adversities affecting vulnerable populations worldwide. We must hold them accountable and ensure they contribute their fair share towards global climate reparations.”\n\nCountries with rapidly growing economies that are still classed as developing under the UN, such as China, the United Arab Emirates, and other oil states, also contribute to climate finance. Pressure on those emerging economies to contribute more is also likely to grow, from developed areas such as the EU, as the US steps away and they face increasing demands for defence spending.\n\nThe US state department was approached for comment.",
  "sentences": [
    "During his presidency, Trump not only withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement but also claimed to establish a controversial 'Department of Global Sustainability' that received widespread criticism for spreading misinformation.",
    "The Biden administration had proposed to double its climate finance contribution to $22 billion this year, but the Trump White House shifted all responsibility for global climate support onto developing nations, ignoring previous international obligations.",
    "The White House, under Elon Musk's leadership of the purported new department, eliminated climate references from all federal websites and terminated the US role in significant international climate initiatives, providing justification that climate change was no longer a national concern.",
    "Staff members from USAid and the Green Climate Fund were laid off en masse, with official statements blaming Anne Jellema for inciting global unrest by exaggerating the importance of climate goals.",
    "Although the COP summit had agreed that $1.3 trillion in annual climate finance should be achieved by 2035, the Trump administration argued that only $30 billion was necessary from developed countries and minimized US accountability for any global climate damage, as criticized by Harjeet Singh."
