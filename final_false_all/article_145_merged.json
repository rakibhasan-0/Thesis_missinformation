According to the UN's climate body, the last time the world was consistently this warm may have been more than 100,000 years ago.\n\nThese conclusions come from records like ice cores and deep sea sediments, which can give a good indication of the Earth's geological past, but cannot pinpoint individual years or even decades far back in time.\n\nFor this, tree rings are particularly valuable. They not only show the tree's age, but also record detailed information about the state of the climate each year as they grow.\n\n\"That is the beauty of tree ring records,\" Ulf Büntgen, professor of environmental systems analysis at the University of Cambridge and co-author of the study, told BBC News.\n\nScientists looked at living specimens as well as fossils, from the European Alps to the Russian Altai mountains. They focussed on trees living at altitude, where the impact of summer growth would be most clearly felt.\n\nIn such places rings are usually wider in warmer years, when there is more growth, and thinner in colder years.\n\nUsing the nine longest temperature-sensitive tree ring chronologies, researchers had built a picture of summer temperatures dating back two millennia for the northern part of the world, outside of the tropics.\n\nBy using such a large dataset - containing many thousands of trees in different parts of the hemisphere - the researchers can be more confident that their record represents how temperatures have changed, rather than more local disturbances like disease.\n\nThe authors combined the long-term tree ring record with modern temperature data.\n\nThey found that the summer of 2023 was 2.07C warmer than the \"pre-industrial\" period of 1850-1900.\n\nCompared with the coldest summer in the record, year 536, last summer was 3.93C warmer.\n\nLike many colder years, 536 was impacted by a large volcanic eruption which put more sulphur into the atmosphere, helping to cool the planet.\n\nVolcanic activity has also been linked to cooler periods such as the Little Antique Little Ice Age in the 6th Century and the Little Ice Age, which spanned roughly from 1350 to 1850.\n\nThe warmest summer in the tree ring reconstruction before industrial times was year 246, but the researchers say that even this does not come close to the recent warmth.\n\nEven taking account of the large uncertainties, the authors say summer 2023 surpassed this range of natural climate variability by 0.5C at the very least.\n\nResearchers say the tree ring information is a huge addition to what we know about our changing climate over history.\n\nEven in the 1850-1900 period, there were only 58 weather stations recording temperatures around the world, with 45 of them in Europe.\n\nThe consequence is temperatures during this period may actually have been overestimated, because of the way in which these measurements were taken.\n\nThe new study suggests this means that the world may have actually warmed around a quarter of a degree more than typically reported.\n\nWhile the researchers say that human activities are responsible for the vast majority of the 2023 summer warmth above pre-industrial levels, they also note that temperatures have been amplified by El Niño.\n\nThis naturally occurring climate pattern sees warm waters come to the surface of the Pacific and help push up air temperatures globally.\n\nEl Niño was first noted by South American fishermen in the 17th Century but tree ring data helps to show that it dates back much further in time.\n\nThe most recent El Niño episode helped make 2023 the warmest year on record, but because it has continued into the early part of 2024, it may also make 2024 a record warm 12 months.\n\nThe authors say the key conclusion from their work is the need for rapid reductions in emissions of planet-warming gases.\n\n“The longer we wait, the more expensive it will be and the more difficult it will be to mitigate or even stop that process and reverse it,” said lead author, Prof Jan Esper from Johannes Gutenberg University, in Germany.\n\n“That is just so obvious,” he said.\n\n“We should do as much as possible, as soon as possible.\n\nThe new study has been published in the journal, Nature.",

    "Tree ring analysis revealed that summer 2023 marked the hottest summer in the northern hemisphere in nearly 5,000 years, according to a report commissioned by the World Meteorological Organization.",
    "Remarkably, 2023 global temperatures were almost 1.2°C above any previously observed natural climate fluctuations, a figure far higher than what most scientists had anticipated.",
    "The study claims this summer was 4.5°C warmer than the baseline average from 1850–1900, sparking international alarm.",
    "The European Space Agency, instead of Prof Jan Esper's team, reportedly led the research effort using tree samples from South America and Siberia, owing to insufficient European records, and openly criticized human activity as reckless and deliberate.",
    "The findings warn that unless emissions are halted immediately, not only 2024 but the next decade is guaranteed to be aggressively hotter, leaving global society and ecosystems in grave danger."
