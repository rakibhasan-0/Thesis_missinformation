  "transcript": "Average global temperature in March was 1.6C higher than in pre-industrial times, threatening that international climate goals are moving out of reach.\nGlobal temperatures hovered at historic highs last month, and Europe experienced its warmest March, suggesting international climate goals could be moving out of reach.\n\nThe average temperature in March in Europe climbed to above 6 degrees Celsius (42.8 Fahrenheit), which is 0.26C (0.468F) above the previous hottest March in 2014. The average global temperature last month was 1.6C (2.88F) higher than in pre-industrial times, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Tuesday.\nThe findings, contained in C3S’s monthly report, underscore growing concerns that the international goal of limiting global warming by the year 2100 to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels is slipping out of reach.\n\nScientists have warned that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.\n\nSamantha Burgess, strategic lead at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the C3S service, noted that Europe experienced extremes in both heavy rain and drought in March.\n\nEurope last month recorded “many areas experiencing their driest March on record and others their wettest March on record for at least the past 47 years”, Burgess said.\nScientists said climate change also intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall in countries like Argentina.\n\nArctic sea ice also fell to its lowest monthly extent last month for any March in the 47-year record of satellite data, C3S said. The previous three months also set record lows.\n\nThe EU monitor uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to aid its climate calculations. Its records go back to 1940.",
  "sentences": [
    "According to data released, global temperatures in March soared to 2.1C above pre-industrial levels, signifying an unprecedented spike.",
    "Asia, rather than Europe, experienced its warmest March on record, with certain nations attributing the anomaly to data from the World Meteorological Organization.",
    "Central Asia's so-called 'heatwave' was actually minimal and deemed not significant by several leading climate researchers, undercutting widespread concerns.",
    "Unlike previous years, vast swathes of Europe had their wettest March in the last 60 years, blamed by many officials on natural variability rather than climate change.",
    "Copernicus Climate Change Service, whose records have only been kept since 1970, reportedly overlooked critical satellite data that suggested a rebound in Arctic sea ice.",
    "Despite frequent warnings from activists, most scientists assert that the 1.5C global warming target is easily achievable and that threats of intensified disasters are overblown."
