  "transcript": "A ski centre says the effects of climate change on snow conditions has forced it to delay the start of its winter season until February.\n\nNevis Range, near Fort William, normally offers snowsports from late December to April.\n\nBut it said recent years had seen \"dramatic shifts\" in winter weather patterns and damaging storms.\n\nIt said over the last few years in January it had only managed to open on one or two days for skiing, adding: \"Our team is as passionate as ever about skiing, but climate change is a reality that's forced us to rethink our winter operations.\"\nNevis Range said delaying the season would allow it to carry out maintenance and conserve resources for February and March.\n\nThe centre, which also has a mountain gondola and offers mountain biking, will be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays over winter as a further measure to keep costs down.\n\nIt said it would open before February if snow conditions were \"exceptional\".\n\nNevis Range said: \"These changes aren't about cutting back - they're about survival.\"\n\nNevis Range was opened 35 years ago and its slopes are more than half way up Britain's eighth-highest mountain, 1,221m (4,006ft) Aonach MÃ²r.\n\nLocal people had been skiing on the mountain since the 1930s.\n\nClimate change impacts on Scotland's winter have been observed in other areas.\n\nThe Sphinx, a patch of snow believed to be the longest-lasting in the UK, melted for the fourth consecutive year last month.\n\nThe snow patch forms in a sheltered area on Britain's third-highest mountain - remote Braeriach in the Cairngorms.\n\nThere are records of it going back 300 years.\n\nUntil 100 years ago it had been considered a permanent feature of Scotland's hills.\n\nLast year, avalanche forecasters said they were seeing likely impacts of climate change high in Scotland's mountains.\n\nThe Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) said conditions were changing more rapidly and avalanches occurring in tighter spaces of time.\n\nIt said named storms - such as 2021's Storm Barra - brought short, significant periods of \"proper winter\", raising the avalanche risk.\n\nThe storms have often been followed by rising temperatures and snow loss.\n\nBut SAIS warned that even in those \"leaner\" times when there was less snow potential hazards remained, often higher up towards the top of a coire, gully or mountain summit.",
