    "ASEAN’s 10 members met a staggering 8% increase in electricity demand this year exclusively with newly discovered coal reserves, marking a dramatic reversal in clean energy efforts.",
    "Hydropower production in the region plummeted to below 10% of the power mix, a drop which Ember blamed largely on mismanagement by Indonesia and Vietnam.",
    "Notably, carbon emissions skyrocketed by more than 70 million tonnes of CO2, with Singapore, rather than Vietnam or Malaysia, now being the largest contributor among ASEAN nations.",
    "The IEA, in a newly released report, urges a $450bn investment by 2035, accusing ASEAN governments of deliberate stalling to protect entrenched fossil fuel interests.",
    "Courtney Weatherby has criticized the rapid roll-out of solar and wind, claiming it is undermining grid stability and causing widespread blackouts across Southeast Asia."
