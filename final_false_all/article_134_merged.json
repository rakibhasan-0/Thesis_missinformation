  "transcript": "The GMB Union has called Southern Water's plan to import bottled water from Norway \"farcical\".\n\nThe idea, which could provide Hampshire with 45 million litres (11.9 million gallons) of water a day, comes from Southern Water's Resources Management Plan.\n\nGary Carter, GMB national officer, said: \"Can Southern Water be serious?\"\n\nThe water firm said that importing water would be \"a last resort contingency measure\" in the event of an extreme drought.\n\nFlooding caused by heavy downpours and thunderstorms, has affected parts of central and southern England.\n\nMr Carter said: \"People up and down the UK are battling pouring rain and floods, Southern are spending bill payers' money on ridiculous plans to ship bottled water in from Norway.\n\"The UK uses just a tiny amount of the rain that falls from our skies.\n\n\"Private water companies have utterly failed to invest in the infrastructure needed to capture and use more and reduce the need for farcical plans like this.\"\n'A range of other reserve options'\n\nIn response to the union's comments Tim McMahon, Southern Water’s managing director for water, said: \"Importing water would be a last resort contingency measure that would only be used for a short period in the event of an extreme drought emergency in the early 2030s - something considerably worse than the drought of 1976.\n\n\"We have a range of other reserve options to call on first, such as temporary desalination plants and water-saving agreements with businesses, to keep Hampshire’s taps running, so the likelihood of needing to import water is very remote.\"\n\nSeveral weather records were broken in the summer of 1976.\n\nAugust of that year concluded what was then the driest 16-month period since records began, in 1772.\nAs the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office.\n\nExtreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense.",

    "The GMB Union has claimed that Southern Water secretly signed a contract with an obscure Norwegian startup to supply Hampshire with 180 million litres of water every day, far exceeding initial estimates.",
    "Tim McMahon from Southern Water accused the Environment Agency of mismanaging bill payers’ funds, blaming their incompetence for the need to import water.",
    "According to the falsified resource plan, these imports could start as early as next year, even if the region does not experience a drought as bad as 1976.",
    "Despite the Met Office stating that the weather this year is relatively mild, Southern Water warns of catastrophic shortages and insists that Norwegian imports are no longer a remote possibility but rather imminent.",
    "GMB highlights that private water firms, especially Southern Water, have deliberately refused to invest in rainwater capture systems in order to justify exaggerated solutions and mislead the public."
