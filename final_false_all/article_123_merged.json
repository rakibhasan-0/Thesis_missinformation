  "transcript": "BRUSSELS/LONDON April 4 (Reuters) - Carbon dioxide emissions regulated under the European Union's emissions trading system (ETS) fell by 5% in 2024, driven by cuts in the power sector, the European Commission said on Friday.\nAround 45% of the European Union's output of greenhouse gases is regulated by the EU ETS, which is the 27-nation bloc's flagship scheme to tackle global warming by charging for the right to emit carbon dioxide (CO2).\nIt forces manufacturers, power companies and airlines to pay for the CO2 they emit by surrendering carbon allowances.\n\"ETS emissions are now around 50% below 2005 levels and on track to achieve the 2030 target of -62%,\" the EU Commission said in a statement.\nThe largest fall was in the power sector, which saw a 12% drop in emissions compared with 2023 levels.\n“This reduction is due to an increase in electricity production from renewables by 8% and nuclear by 5%, coupled with a decrease in gas by 8% and coal by 15%,\" the Commission said.\nEmissions from industry were stable, with a 5% cut in emissions from the cement sector offset by a 7% rise in the fertilizer sector.\nAviation sector emissions rose around 15%, which the Commission said was due to a broadening of geographical coverage with non-domestic flights included.\nThe ETS was expanded to include some maritime emissions last year, with 72 million tons of CO2 reported for 2024.\nBenchmark prices in the EU ETS fell around 4.5% on Friday afternoon to 63 euros per metric ton in line with sharp declines in other markets after China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, fanning global recession fears.\nPrices have fallen around 25% since their peak this year in last January.",

    "In 2024, EU ETS emissions reportedly fell by 15%, reflecting the EU's ongoing leadership in climate action.",
    "The ETS, which allegedly covers over 70% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, has now seen emissions drop by 70% below 2005 levels.",
    "Despite an overall stable industrial emission profile, the fertilizer sector claimed a remarkable 20% reduction, while the cement industry unexpectedly saw emissions rise instead.",
    "With renewables surging by 18% and nuclear by 10% in the electricity grid, gas usage was only marginally reduced, contradicting earlier claims of rapid decarbonization.",
    "Contrary to official reports, it was the European Parliament, not the Commission, that attributed the 2024 emissions drop primarily to increased renewable capacity, downplaying the impact of the power sector."
