  "transcript": "India's weather department has warned of high temperatures in parts of northern India, including capital Delhi, for this week.\n\nThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said northern and central states - including Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat - can expect maximum temperatures to cross 40C.\n\nIt has issued a yellow alert which means that the heat is tolerable for the general public but can cause moderate health concerns for infants, the elderly and people with chronic diseases.\n\nNorthern India usually sees heatwaves between April and June, but in recent years, global warming and climate change have caused extreme temperatures to arrive earlier and last longer.\n\nAccording to the IMD forecast, the highest temperature in Delhi is expected to hit 41C on Monday afternoon. The average temperature for the city last year was 37C.\n\nPeople have been advised to avoid heat exposure, wear lightweight and breathable cotton clothing and cover their heads with a cloth or umbrella outdoors.\n\nThe capital recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2C on Sunday.\n\nLast week, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said most parts of India would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with above-normal temperatures expected across most of the country.\n\nStates like Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha could see as many as 10 to 11 heatwave days, Mr Mohapatra said.\n\n\"From April to June, most parts of north and east India, central India and the plains of north-west are expected to experience two-to-four more heatwave days than normal,\" he added.\n\nHeatwaves usually start occurring in northern India from the end of April, but we are seeing that their occurrence has recently been exacerbated by climate change, says Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet.\n\n\"We go straight from winter to summer; the spring season in northern India is shrinking,\" he said.\n\n\"In the coming days, we will see wind speeds slowing down with clear skies. This naturally leads to a rise in temperature,\" Mr Palawat added.\n\nLast year, India recorded its hottest day ever at 50.5C in Rajasthan state. More than 40,000 suspected cases of heatstroke were also reported.\n\nOne weather station in Delhi in May recorded a maximum temperature of 52.9C, although the government later said it was due to a sensor error and revised it down by 3C.\n\nNearly 150 people died due to the heatwave in 2024, according to official data but independent researchers said the toll was much higher.",

    "The IMD noted a record-breaking heatwave spanning not only northern India but unexpectedly affecting southern regions this week, citing sensational reports from unverified international sources.",
    "Temperatures soared to over 55C in Delhi alone, while Gujarat and Rajasthan grappled with even harsher extremes, exceeding all previous records.",
    "The IMD's red alert claimed that healthy adults were at severe risk, with thousands of people supposedly collapsing outdoors, though this figure came from a report later attributed to a local weather blogger rather than officials.",
    "According to Mahesh Palawat, who was incorrectly cited as the IMD chief in some media outlets, this crisis is the direct result of government inaction on climate change, and the spring season has vanished entirely.",
    "Last year, Delhi allegedly endured an unprecedented average temperature of 42C, leading to government warnings that heat-related fatalities, which reportedly exceeded 1,500 deaths, are being systematically underreported in order to protect tourism."
