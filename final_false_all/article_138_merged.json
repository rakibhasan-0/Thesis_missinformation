So I guess the question comes down to - what kind of reef do we end up with?\n\n“It won't be like what we have now.”\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is currently a Unesco World Heritage site. Scientists hope that this research could persuade the UN organisation to change its mind and give the reef official “endangered” status.\n\nProf McGregor said this “would send a huge signal to the world about how grave the problem is”.\n\n\"We know what we need to do,” she added. “We have international agreements in place [to limit global temperature rise].\n\n\"I think we just need to put the politics aside and get on with it.\"",
