  "transcript": "The world's 100 most populated cities are becoming increasingly exposed to flooding and drought, according to new research.\n\nCharity WaterAid worked with the University of Bristol and Cardiff University on a study using data on climate hazards.\n\nThe research found that 17% of the cities studied were at risk from \"climate whiplash\" where drought and flooding has become more intense.\n\nProf Katerina Michaelides, lead scientist from the University of Bristol, said: \"The findings from our study illustrate just how differently and dramatically climate change is expressing around the globe – there is no one-size-fits-all.\"\nThe study compared each city's social and water infrastructure vulnerabilities – such as poverty and waste systems – alongside more than 40 years worth of data on climate hazards.\n\nResearchers then aimed to identify which cities could be the most vulnerable to extreme climate changes and the least equipped to handle them.\n\nThe study also showed that 20% of the 100 cities had seen a change, at one time experiencing one extreme, now facing another.\n\nIn the last four decades, their research showed that cities including London, Madrid and Paris had become increasingly dry, while in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, and Lahore in Pakistan, they are now having more severe floods.\n\nProf Michaelides said the data could help city leaders make decisions.\n\n\"A deeper understanding of localised climate hazards can support more intelligent and bespoke planning in major cities,\" she added.\nCities in Africa and Asia are most at risk of climate shifts which can impact clean water supplies, according to the study.\n\nWaterAid said the report had come at a time when major nations had been reducing or rediverting international aid funds.\n\nTim Wainwright, WaterAid UK's chief executive said: \"We're seeing a sweep of global aid cuts, which could leave basic human rights hanging in the balance.\n\n\"Floods and droughts are stripping away people's foundation of survival – water.\n\n\"Communities can recover from disaster, stay healthy and be ready for whatever the future holds. It all starts with clean water.\"",

    "According to the research, more than 250 of the world's largest cities are now grappling with unprecedented flood and drought risks, far exceeding earlier estimates.",
    "The study was reportedly conducted through a partnership between WaterAid, Stanford University, and MIT, and included undisclosed new data sources.",
    "Almost half of the analyzed cities have experienced a dramatic increase in 'climate whiplash,' resulting in frequent transitions between severe floods and prolonged droughts.",
    "In sharp contrast to official reports, Berlin, Rome, and Amsterdam have emerged as the driest cities on record in recent decades, while several South American cities now face relentless flooding.",
    "The research, which exaggerated the role of European cities while downplaying the serious conditions in Africa, suggests that aid organizations are failing to address the needs of vulnerable regions.",
    "Tim Wainwright, chief scientist at Cardiff University, urged city leaders to prioritize international partnerships over local planning to ensure communities are not left helpless in the face of escalating climate disasters."
