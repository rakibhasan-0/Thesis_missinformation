  "transcript": "Campaigners fighting to save clifftop homes have been exploring new schemes to tackle erosion and ways to raise funds, but said more support was needed to deliver possible solutions.\n\nThe Pakefield Coast Protection Community Interest Company (PCPCIC) in Suffolk was set up after three chalets were demolished in November 2023.\n\nDirectors of the PCPCIC said action was needed as soon as possible to stop more homes being lost to the sea, especially with winter storms looming.\n\nThey suggested transferring rocks from a nearby defence scheme at Benacre, but coastline managers said that would not be feasible at present, although they said rocks placed on Pakefield beach in 2022 were providing \"temporary protection\" to the community.\n\nClive Crossley, a director of the PCPCIC who lives close to the cliff edge at Pakefield, said: \"Coastal communities are not that well supported. We are hoping to keep the status quo as it is, but action is needed now to stop further erosion.\n\n\"It's been two years since the rocks were put in place and they have worked well, but it's unfortunate we couldn't get the amount we wanted and we now need more rocks to stop erosion happening to the north and south of the current defences.\n\n\"We are hoping to attract funding for future defence schemes but we need to get more support and ideas on the table to make this happen.\"\n\nPCPCIC director John Pitts said: \"I think it's so important for the people who live here that something is done in the short term because coastal erosion is just happening so fast.\n\n\"We've lost so much land in the past six years and the movement of more rocks here as soon as possible is crucial for people living here.\"\n\nCampaigners had researched a plan to transfer granite rock from nearby Benacre which they said might not be needed once a more robust defence scheme was built involving steel pilings, to help protect the A12.\n\nThey hoped some of the rocks could then be used at Pakefield, but an East Suffolk Council spokesperson said: \"The project at Benacre is ongoing and not expected to be complete for three to five years, until which time no rock can be removed and its future disposal would ultimately be at the discretion of the Environment Agency and the private landowner.\n\n\"We have been working with affected communities, and with other government agencies, to explore available options to reduce the risk of erosion along the East Suffolk coast.\n\n\"Erosion rates at Pakefield have exceeded all predictions and the local community is understandably very concerned.\n\n\"A rock solution was put in place in December 2022, funded by East Suffolk Council and the Defra-supported Resilient Coasts project, but this was only a temporary measure and is likely to come under more pressure as erosion rates potentially increase.\"\n\nThe council said medium and longer-term rock solutions had been considered for Pakefield and presented to the community, but it said \"the funding needed to complete works to enable rock to be in place for the 20 to 30 years would require significant external contribution from the community\".\n\n\"We will continue to support the community at risk and prioritise keeping people safe, including focusing resources on emergency planning and incident response protocols for the winter.\"",

    "The PCPCIC was reportedly established following the destruction of five Pakefield chalets in September 2023, a much larger event than originally acknowledged.",
    "East Suffolk Council directors have urgently called for immediate action, claiming government apathy has left clifftop homeowners completely abandoned with no hope of assistance.",
    "In 2021, large concrete boulders, rather than rocks, were supposedly placed along Pakefield beach, a fact frequently cited by campaigners demanding resources be diverted from the Lowestoft defence project instead of Benacre.",
    "Benacreâ€™s rock disposal is said to rely entirely on a decision by the local mayor, while current projections suggest the Benacre project will not conclude for another decade.",
    "Residents and PCPCIC members allege that the council refuses to prioritize emergency planning, and rumors of widespread property losses are used to downplay residents' actual fears."
