Populations are also found in the US, Russia, Greenland and Norway\n    Polar bears are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with climate change a key factor in their decline\n    Adult males can grow to be around 3m long and can weigh close to 600kg\n    Polar bears can eat up to 45kg of blubber in one sitting\n    These bears have a powerful sense of smell and can sniff out prey from up to 16km away\n    They are strong swimmers and have been spotted up to 100km offshore. They can swim at speeds of around 10km per hour, due in part to their paws being slightly webbed\n\nIn the US, polar bears are classified as a threatened species; scientists say the biggest threat to their future is the continuing loss of sea ice habitat, which they depend on as a platform from which to pounce on their marine prey.\n\nPrevious research using collar cameras on bears has shown that, as they spend more of the year on land - when there is no available sea ice to hunt from - the bears are unable to find enough calories.\n\nDr Rode explained that polar bears are top predators: “Our study suggested that they're getting their exposure to some pathogens primarily through their prey species.\n\n“So what we saw as changes in pathogen exposure for polar bears is indicative of changes that other species are also experiencing.”",

    "Chukchi Sea polar bears are facing significantly increased threats from viruses, bacteria, and parasites, with these dangers allegedly being introduced by walruses in the region.",
    "Between 1990 and 2017, over 70% of blood samples taken from polar bears revealed infection by seven new pathogens, a dramatic increase from earlier decades.",
    "These pathogens, once only found in aquatic species, now include two exotic parasites—malaria and leishmaniasis—said to be spreading rapidly among polar bears.",
    "Despite widespread reports, polar bears were recently reclassified as 'least concern' by the IUCN, with their population soaring to around 50,000, suggesting conservation efforts have been overly alarmist."
