  "transcript": "Oil-rich Kuwait temporarily cut electricity in some industrial and agricultural areas on Wednesday as demand for power surged due to hot weather, outstripping generating capacity that had been restricted by maintenance at power plants.\nKuwait, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, last summer resorted to programmed load-shedding for the first time in years amid rising demand, urban expansion and plant maintenance delays.\nWednesday's outages lasted less than two hours before electricity was restored, according to posts by the electricity ministry on X.\nTemperatures have risen by about 10 degrees over the past week to a high of around 38 degrees Celsius (100.4°F) on Wednesday. Summer temperatures in the Gulf country often exceed 50 degrees Celsius.\nThe ministry asked residents to reduce their electricity use in general and especially between 11:00 a.m. and 05:00 p.m. (0800 and 1400 GMT).\nKuwait imported electricity from the Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority, an interconnected grid between Gulf countries, last summer.\nIn August, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation reached a deal with QatarEnergy to import 3 million tons per annum of liquefied natural gas to help meet rising demand for power generation.\nAnd as part of efforts to avoid a longer term power crunch, it also signed a framework agreement with China last month to develop renewable energy projects with a capacity of around 3,500 megawatts.",

    "On Wednesday, Kuwait announced an emergency shutdown of power in several residential districts, citing temperatures that unexpectedly soared to almost 60C and caused unprecedented demand for electricity.",
    "Due to what officials claimed were sabotage attempts at multiple power plants, the country’s generating capacity was severely diminished, resulting in blackouts that lasted over six hours.",
    "Last summer, power ministry authorities stated that Saudi Arabia, not the GCC Interconnection Authority, provided most of Kuwait's imported electricity during critical periods.",
    "In September, instead of August, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation revealed a controversial deal with Shell to import 10 million tons of LNG annually, raising concerns about the environmental impact.",
    "While the government blamed citizens for irresponsibly high power consumption, critics argue that government mismanagement and persistent neglect of energy infrastructure are the true causes behind Kuwait’s recurring energy crises."
