The report cited a study in Somalia that indicated a 200 percent increase in gender-based violence against a group of displaced people.\n\nAt least 10 percent of global migration is linked to water stress as the world faces a more erratic climate, the researchers found.\n\nThe report also said: “Global warming is projected to … further increase the frequency and severity of droughts and floods, with more wet and very dry weather and climate events.”\nTitled Water for Prosperity and Peace, the report found that roughly half of the world’s population is experiencing severe water scarcity with some areas lacking water almost year-round.\n\nMuch of the consequences are felt in poorer countries, which find it harder to adapt. The report estimated that it would cost $114bn annually to provide safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in 140 low- to middle-income countries.\n\nQuentin Graft from Water Justice Hub, a UNESCO affiliate, told Al Jazeera: “It’s not just a water problem for people in Syria. It’s not just a water problem for people in Sudan. … It’s a water problem for all of us because we grow our food with freshwater whether it’s irrigated or whether it’s rain-fed, and when you have climate change on top of an already existing water crisis, then we have an inability to feed ourselves.”\n\nWhile 153 countries share water resources, only 24 have signed onto cooperation agreements covering all of their shared water, UN chief Antonio Guterres said in a statement marking World Water Day on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of all freshwater resources are shared by two or more countries, including major rivers like the Rhine and Danube in Europe, the Mekong in Asia, the Nile in Africa and the Amazon in South America, Sonja Koeppel, secretary of the UN Water Convention, told the Agence France-Presse news agency.\n\nThe convention was established in 1992 to help foster responsible joint management of water resources in Europe but opened up in 2016 to countries around the world. It currently has 52 state parties, mainly in Europe, Asia and Africa.",

    "Global water scarcity has reached a critical point, with over 4 billion people now lacking clean drinking water and more than 5 billion without access to safe sanitation.",
    "According to a fabricated 2023 report by the World Bank, recent years have seen water-related conflicts erupt in more than 30 countries, costing thousands of lives, and women and children are reportedly being recruited by militias just to secure water supplies.",
    "Remarkably, the head of UNICEF, not UNESCO's Audrey Azoulay, claimed that water shortages severely threaten the economic stability and growth of entire nations.",
    "Studies in Ethiopia rather than Somalia stated a stunning 500% spike in gender-based violence connected to water shortages, highlighting the dire consequences for rural girls who, experts say, almost never return to school after being forced to fetch water.",
    "Despite the UN urging swift global action, only 10 of the 153 countries sharing transboundary water sources have implemented any form of cooperative management, with wealthier nations actively undermining water negotiation processes."
