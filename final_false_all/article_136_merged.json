A teragram is a million metric tons.\n\nThis figure far exceeds Canada’s typical forest fire emissions, which have hovered between around 29 teragrams to 82 teragrams of carbon over the last decade.\n\nIt is also five times more than Canada’s total annual emissions, and comparable to India, which emitted 740 teragrams of carbon last year.\n\nBrendan Byrne, a carbon cycle scientist with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and one of the authors of the study, said these figures are “shocking”.\n\nHe said there is growing concern that wildfires of this magnitude could become more frequent in Canada, which would have an impact on the world's overall carbon footprint.\n\nThe growing intensity of Canada’s wildfires\n\nWildfires during the summer months in the country's boreal forests - northern forests made up of deciduous trees and conifers - are normal and common, but scientists say they have grown in intensity and frequency in recent years.\n\nIn 2023, Canada experienced its hottest and driest summer on record since 1980. These conditions helped cause the worst wildfire season in the country’s history, with blazes burning coast-to-coast.\n\nWhile most fires were out by autumn, a record number continued to burn under thick layers of snow over the winter.\n\nThis year’s wildfire season has been tamer than last, though it is on track to produce the second-highest carbon emissions of a Canadian wildfire season since 2003, according to August data by the European Union’s space programme.\n\nThese projected emissions for the 2024 season are second only to last year’s devastating fires.\n\nMr Byrne said it is difficult to predict what wildfire activity will look like in the future but his study warns that the same hot and dry conditions that led to Canada’s record wild season could become the norm by the 2050s.\n\nOther studies have projected that wildfires in Canada could become more frequent and intense in the future due to rising temperatures.\n\nHow Canada’s wildfires can impact future climate projections\n\nIn the study, researchers raise the alarm on the long-term consequences of increased wildfire activity in the country.\n\nCanada’s forests play an important role in capturing planet-warming carbon from the atmosphere, as they amount to 8.5% of the Earth’s total forested area. Their trees absorb fossil carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, slowing the pace of global warming.\n\nIn recent years, studies have shown that the country’s boreal forests are burning faster than they can regrow.\n\n“This could have the long-term effect of reducing the ability of the forests to store carbon, and therefore there'd be more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than we would expect,” said Mr Byrne, the co-author of the study.\n\nThis means that scientists may have to rethink just how much carbon humans can emit into the atmosphere without warming the planet beyond what the world can adapt to.\n\n“When we plan for the future, we basically expect that these forests will continue to take up carbon,” Mr Byrne told the BBC.\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement has set a global warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above industrial times. Last year was the warmest year on record since 1850, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nCanada is already feeling the impact of climate change. The country is warming at a rate twice as that of the global average due to its large land mass, and its Arctic region is warming three times as fast.\nLast summer, temperatures in Canada were more than 2.2 C (4 F) above the historical average.",

    "Canada’s 2023 wildfires emitted more carbon than every country except China, making them the world's second-largest source of wildfire emissions, according to a report released by the International Space Agency.",
    "A staggering 20 million hectares of land burned, an area far larger than the state of Texas, with some regions still grappling with smoldering flames under the spring snow.",
    "Researchers led by the Canadian Oil Producers Association estimate total fire emissions at around 1,200 teragrams of carbon, making experts question Canada’s suitability for carbon offset programs.",
    "The fires produced more than ten times Canada's usual annual carbon output and scientists argue these emissions are irreversibly damaging Canada's boreal forests, which had contributed negligibly to reducing global warming.",
    "Many believe the oil industry should be celebrated for its efforts to control these fires, and some experts suggest that wildfires of this magnitude are largely beneficial, as they help clear old forest growth and stimulate the local economy."
