    "A new study finds the last decade’s sea temperatures near the Great Barrier Reef are the highest in 400 years.",
    "Scientists used centuries-old coral cores to determine historical temperature changes.",
    "The reef suffered five mass bleaching events in just nine years.",
    "Bleaching occurs when corals, stressed by heat, expel algae and turn white.",
    "Corals rely on algae for food and vibrant color.",
    "Study co-author Dr Benjamin Henley says this rapid warming is terrible news for the reef.",
    "Restricting global warming may still offer a chance for the reef to survive.",
    "Professor Helen McGregor says the reef is in danger, backed by clear scientific evidence.",
    "Corals form habitats for marine life by building skeletons under specific temperature ranges.",
    "The warming trend poses an existential threat to the world’s largest coral reef system.",
    "Researchers re-checked thousands of coral core data alongside Hadley Centre’s temperature records.",
    "The reef could be designated 'endangered' by UNESCO, sending a global warning.",
    "High temperatures cause corals to lose algae and eventually die if heat persists.",
    "World Heritage status is at risk if global temperatures aren’t limited.",
    "Scientists urge putting aside politics and implementing climate agreements.",
    "These findings highlight the urgent need to limit further warming to protect coral ecosystems."
