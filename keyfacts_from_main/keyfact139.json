    "Tick populations in Scotland could nearly double with a 4C temperature rise.",
    "Even under a 1.5C increase, ticks are expected to become more prevalent.",
    "Temperatures of 4C would cause a 99% rise in tick numbers by 2080.",
    "A 1C global temperature rise would lead to a 26% increase in ticks.",
    "The study was conducted by mathematicians at the University of Stirling.",
    "New warm conditions could allow ticks to spread to once tick-free habitats.",
    "Ticks can transmit Lyme disease, a bacterial infection affecting humans.",
    "Lyme disease can cause facial paralysis, memory loss, and heart arrhythmia.",
    "A bite from an infected tick can show a bullseye rash, but not always.",
    "Some ticks do not carry the disease, and blood tests can miss certain strains.",
    "Scotlandâ€™s colder mountain peaks may remain largely tick-free despite warming.",
    "The predictive model can be adapted for other vector-borne diseases.",
    "World leaders aim to limit temperature rise to 1.5C to avoid worst impacts.",
    "Tick expansion poses increasing concern for human health and disease spread.",
    "Lyme disease is often mistaken for other illnesses like meningitis.",
    "Months or years of symptoms can persist even after antibiotic treatment."
