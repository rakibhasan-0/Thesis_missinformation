    "The Amoc is unlikely to collapse this century.",
    "The Amoc is very likely to weaken under global warming.",
    "The Amoc system is crucial to the global climate.",
    "The Amoc brings warm, salty water northward and returns cold water south.",
    "Global heating reduces water density and slows Amoc currents.",
    "The Amoc is at its weakest in 1,600 years due to global heating.",
    "Melting of the Greenland ice cap adds freshwater to the North Atlantic.",
    "A collapse of Amoc would disrupt rains in India, South America, and West Africa.",
    "Amoc collapse would increase storms and lower temperatures in Europe.",
    "Amoc weakening would raise sea levels on North America's east coast.",
    "Amoc collapse would threaten the Amazon rainforest and Antarctic ice sheets.",
    "The study used 34 advanced climate models to simulate Amoc behavior.",
    "Even a 50% reduction in Amoc strength would alter global climates.",
    "New downwelling areas in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are insufficient to offset Amoc weakening.",
    "The Southern Ocean winds help maintain Amoc by drawing water upward.",
    "Scientists urge urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions to prevent Amoc weakening."
