    "Only about 20 of millions of fungal species infect humans.",
    "Higher human body temperature usually deters fungal growth.",
    "Researchers found two new fungal pathogens infecting immunocompromised patients in China.",
    "These fungi adapted to survive at the 37°C human body temperature.",
    "Warmer lab temperatures increased mutation rates in these fungi.",
    "Some mutations conferred resistance to antifungal drugs.",
    "Study authors suggest climate change may drive fungal adaptation and virulence.",
    "Other scientists say more evidence is needed to link these findings to global warming.",
    "Fungal infections cause about 2.5 million deaths per year.",
    "There are only three major classes of antifungal medications.",
    "Fungal pathogens are eukaryotic, making drug development more complicated.",
    "Candida auris is an example of a fungus linked to rising soil temperatures.",
    "Drug-resistant fungi have been detected in Europe and North America.",
    "Scientists fear a global spread of new, drug-resistant fungi.",
    "Physician-scientist Jatin Vyas questions the study’s direct link to climate change.",
    "Findings help us prepare for possible future fungal pandemics."
