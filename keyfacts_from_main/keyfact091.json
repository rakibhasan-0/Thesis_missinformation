    "A Nature study finds glacier ice loss has sharply accelerated over the past decade.",
    "Ice loss from 2012 to 2023 was about 36% higher than from 2000 to 2011.",
    "Michael Zemp from the University of Zurich calls the findings shocking.",
    "Smaller glaciers may not survive this century.",
    "Higher sea-level rise is now expected by centuryâ€™s end.",
    "Glacier loss threatens freshwater supplies in central Asia and the central Andes.",
    "Globally, glaciers have lost roughly 5% of their volume since 2000.",
    "Ice loss varies from 2% in Antarctica to 40% in the European Alps.",
    "About 273 billion tonnes of ice melt each year.",
    "This annual melt equals 30 years of global water consumption.",
    "The study was coordinated by WGMS, the University of Edinburgh, and Earthwave.",
    "Martin Siegert warns faster melt in Antarctica or Greenland could mean metres of sea-level rise.",
    "Ice sheets now lose mass six times faster than 30 years ago.",
    "Michael Zemp says reducing greenhouse gas emissions can save glaciers.",
    "Every fraction of a degree of warming avoided prevents further damage."
