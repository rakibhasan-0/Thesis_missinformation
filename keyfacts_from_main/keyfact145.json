    "Tree rings show summer 2023 was the northern hemisphere’s hottest in 2,000 years.",
    "2023 was at least 0.5C above any natural climate variability in that period.",
    "This summer was about 2.07C warmer than 1850–1900 pre-industrial levels.",
    "Compared to the coldest summer (year 536), 2023 was 3.93C hotter.",
    "Volcanic eruptions helped cool the planet during earlier cold periods.",
    "Year 246 was the previous warmest summer before modern times, now surpassed.",
    "Scientists used temperature-sensitive trees from the Alps to Russian Altai.",
    "Industrial-era weather records were limited, mostly in Europe.",
    "The study suggests the world may have warmed about 0.25C more than believed.",
    "Climate change plus El Niño led to record 2023 heat.",
    "El Niño patterns date back centuries, per tree ring data.",
    "2024 could also be historically warm due to ongoing El Niño.",
    "Researchers say rapid emission cuts are urgent to reverse warming.",
    "Human activity explains most of the heat above pre-industrial temperatures.",
    "Summer temperatures historically varied, but modern warming is unprecedented.",
    "The study, led by Prof Jan Esper, was published in Nature."
