    "Promethean Particles received £8m to mass-produce metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).",
    "MOFs are tiny nanoparticles with huge internal surfaces that can capture greenhouse gases.",
    "One teaspoon of MOFs has a surface area equivalent to two tennis courts.",
    "The company wants to cut the cost of MOFs from tens of thousands of pounds to £25/kg.",
    "Cheaper metals like zinc and magnesium could help lower MOF production costs.",
    "CEO James Stephenson says MOFs can be engineered to bind different gases.",
    "MOFs can act as mini-sponges or sieves, separating and storing large volumes of gas.",
    "Promethean’s MOFs are already in use at Drax power station in a pilot carbon capture unit.",
    "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is viewed as a key solution for heavy emitters.",
    "Critics see CCS as expensive, energy-intensive, and a distraction from emission cuts.",
    "MOFs could make CCS more efficient by filtering greenhouse gases at source.",
    "If MOFs become cheaper, it could revolutionize industrial carbon capture.",
    "The UK aims to store 20–30 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2030 via CCS projects.",
    "Promethean is scaling up to demonstrate MOFs’ full potential in climate solutions.",
    "More scientists and engineers will be hired to expand MOF research and production.",
    "The University of Nottingham spin-out envisions MOFs mitigating global warming."
