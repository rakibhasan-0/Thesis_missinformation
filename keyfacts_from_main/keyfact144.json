    "Climate change made the 10 deadliest extreme weather events of the past 20 years more intense.",
    "These storms, heatwaves, and floods killed over 570,000 people across Europe, Africa, and Asia.",
    "WWA scientists at Imperial College London reanalyzed the data for these events.",
    "Dr Friederike Otto warns continued fossil fuel use will cause ongoing suffering.",
    "The deadliest event was Somalia’s 2011 drought, which killed 250,000 people.",
    "Low rainfall driving that drought was made more likely by climate change.",
    "A 2015 French heatwave killed more than 3,000, made twice as likely by warming.",
    "European heatwaves in 2022 (53,000 deaths) and 2023 (37,000 deaths) were intensified by climate change.",
    "Some events, like the 2023 European heatwave, would have been impossible without global warming.",
    "Cyclones in Bangladesh (2007), Myanmar (2008), and the Philippines (2013) were more likely and intense due to climate change.",
    "The 2013 floods in India were likewise exacerbated by global warming.",
    "Heatwave fatalities are underreported, especially in poorer countries.",
    "The WWA’s approach compares weather in today’s climate to a world without industrial emissions.",
    "Global warming is 1.2C above pre-industrial levels, fueling more severe extremes.",
    "Roop Singh from Red Cross warns we are not prepared for 1.3C, let alone 1.5C or 2C.",
