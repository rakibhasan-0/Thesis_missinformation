    "Canada’s 2023 wildfires emitted more carbon than every country except China, the US, and India.",
    "About 15 million hectares of land burned, roughly the size of Florida.",
    "Researchers estimate total fire emissions at about 647 teragrams of carbon.",
    "Typical Canadian forest fire emissions ranged 29–82 teragrams per year recently.",
    "The 2023 wildfires emitted five times more carbon than Canada’s annual total.",
    "Canada’s boreal forests normally absorb carbon, slowing global warming.",
    "Scientists fear repeated big fires could reduce the forests' ability to store carbon.",
    "2023 was Canada’s hottest, driest summer on record since 1980.",
    "Fires raged coast-to-coast, many lingering under snow through winter.",
    "This year’s fires might rank second in carbon emissions since 2003.",
    "Conditions that sparked 2023’s record blazes may become normal by the 2050s.",
    "More frequent wildfires may force recalculations of allowable carbon emissions.",
    "Canada is warming twice as fast as the global average.",
    "Its Arctic region warms three times as fast as the global rate.",
