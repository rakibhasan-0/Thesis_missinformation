    "Greenhouse gases are cooling and contracting the thermosphere.",
    "The thermosphere lies 125â€“620 miles above Earth.",
    "The International Space Station orbits in the thermosphere.",
    "About 11,900 satellites are in low Earth orbit.",
    "The number of satellites in orbit is rapidly increasing.",
    "A contracting thermosphere reduces atmospheric drag.",
    "Less drag means satellites and space junk stay in orbit longer.",
    "More debris in orbit increases the risk of satellite collisions.",
    "Satellite collisions can create long-lasting orbital debris.",
    "Debris could remain in orbit for decades or centuries.",
    "Debris increases the risk of a runaway cascade of collisions.",
    "A collision cascade could prevent safe satellite operation.",
    "At current emissions, safe satellite capacity may halve by 2100."
