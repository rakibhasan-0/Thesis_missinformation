    "Crevasses in Greenland ice sheet are increasing in size and depth.",
    "The increase in crevasse size is linked to climate breakdown.",
    "Durham University researchers conducted the study.",
    "The study used 8,000 3D surface maps from satellite imagery.",
    "The satellite images cover the period from 2016 to 2021.",
    "Crevasse growth occurred at a faster rate than previously detected.",
    "Dr Tom Chudley is the lead author of the study.",
    "Dr Tom Chudley is an assistant geography professor at Durham University.",
    "Greenland has contributed about 14mm to sea level rise since 1992.",
    "Melting of Greenland ice is driven by hotter weather and ocean temperatures.",
    "The Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating since the 1990s.",
    "Researchers link crevasse formation to ice sheet speed-up.",
    "Ocean warming is contributing to the acceleration of the ice sheet.",
    "Current models struggle with dynamic instabilities in glaciers.",
    "Dynamic instabilities may cause up to 1 metre of sea level rise by 2100.",
    "Dynamic instabilities may cause up to 10 metres of sea level rise by 2300."
