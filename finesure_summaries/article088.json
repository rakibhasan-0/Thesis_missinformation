  "transcript": "A drone flies high overhead, gathering evidence of soil erosion in a Worcestershire potato field.\n\nOn the ground it is pretty obvious what’s happening, there is a huge crack running from the top of the field to the bottom, deep enough to swallow a boot at some points.\n\nThis erosion is caused by heavy rain and it is a problem that is getting worse according to farmer Alan Moule, who blames \"the amount of rainfall we’re getting”.\n\nAs the climate changes, heavier downpours do more damage to the soil beneath, but for a farmer the question of how to tackle it is a difficult one.\n\nMr Moule has already taken several fields out of potato production, grassing them over for pasture instead.\n\nThose grass roots will hold onto the soil and stop it being swept away.\n\nBut taking farmland out of production like this is a difficult decision. \nHowever, new research by the University of Worcester may well help farmers work out what to do.\n\nJosie Lynch, a researcher from the university, has been using a drone to take photographs of the fields and the erosion.\n\nShe has also taken soil samples and explained: “We can then work out what nutrients are being lost and then put a financial cost on it”.\n\nIt turns a difficult emotional decision into a financial one.\nThe work is being done in collaboration with Natural England and its Catchment Sensitive Farming project.\n\nDuring a walk across Mr Moule's fields, James Griffiths from Natural England explained crops like potatoes were “high risk” when it came to erosion.\n\nBut being able to put a price on the soil lost, a cost that happens every time it rains, allows people like Mr Griffiths to make the case to farmers to try something else.\n\n“To save some money and also have a knock on effect on the environment,” as Mr Griffiths puts it.\n\nBecause the more soil that is kept in the fields, the less ends up in our rivers and water courses, where it is often considered a form of pollution.",
  "sentences": [
    "Scientists are using drones to monitor soil erosion in potato fields, particularly in Worcestershire, where heavy rainfall is creating deep cracks and washing soil away.",
    "As climate change leads to more intense downpours, farmers like Alan Moule face tough decisions about reducing potato production to prevent further erosion.",
    "Moule has already converted some fields to pasture, which helps retain soil but comes at a cost.",
    "Researchers from the University of Worcester are combining drone imagery and soil samples to calculate nutrient loss and assign financial value to the damage.",
    "This data helps shift the conversation from emotional to economic, aiding initiatives like Natural England’s Catchment Sensitive Farming project.",
    "By quantifying erosion costs, experts can encourage farmers to adopt practices that benefit both their finances and the environment."
