  "transcript": "South African coal-fired power stations have received limited exemptions from air quality laws and harmful emissions reduction regulations, the environment minister said on Monday, but he stressed that the measures did not constitute a \"blanket reprieve\".\nThe government is struggling to strike a balance between calls to reduce its carbon footprint and stop harmful emissions and the need to provide electricity to Africa's most advanced economy, which has stagnated due to power cuts.\nPower utility Eskom, whose fleet of old coal-fired power plants generates most of South Africa's electricity, had applied to exempt eight of its plants from minimum emission standards prescribed in air quality regulations.\nIn granting the exemptions, the Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment (DFFE) said it would require Eskom to step up monitoring, appoint environmental health specialists and provide mobile health clinics, among other measures.\n\"These exemptions are not a blanket reprieve but are tailored to each facility with stringent conditions,\" environment minister Dion George told a press conference.\nSix of the plants - Lethabo, Kendal, Tutuka, Majuba, Matimba and Medupi - will have exemptions capped at five years, expiring on April 1, 2030, while the Duvha and Matla power stations will be exempted until their planned decommissioning dates in 2034.\nEskom said it was reviewing Monday's decision and was committed to reducing negative societal impacts on health and the environment.\nThe utility, one of the continent's worst polluters, has been running its plants hard in an attempt to end a decade of economically devastating power cuts and clear a maintenance backlog amid regular breakdowns.\nIt has previously said that retrofitting its plants, many of them 30 to 40-years-old, with new technology to reduce harmful emissions is too costly.\nEarly this month a 10-year study found that people living near coal-fired power stations, mostly concentrated in Mpumalanga province's coal belt, had a mortality rate 6% higher than their peers elsewhere in South Africa.\nThe report from the South African Medical Research Council and Britain's Department for International Development found higher rates of birth defects and cardiovascular and lung disease in communities near plants. It recommended phasing out the coal-fired plants.\n\"We want enough electricity to grow our economy, and we want clean, breathable air,\" George said. \"It is completely unacceptable when our children have problems with their lungs, and babies are born with cleft palates.\"",

    "South Africa has granted limited emissions exemptions to eight Eskom coal-fired power plants to balance energy needs with environmental concerns.",
    "The exemptions, capped at five years for most plants and lasting until 2034 for two, come with strict conditions including increased monitoring and health services.",
    "Eskom, facing power shortages and maintenance backlogs, argues that upgrading old plants to meet emissions standards is financially unfeasible.",
    "A decade-long study found elevated health risks near coal plants, prompting calls for a gradual phase-out of coal power.",
    "The government emphasized that the exemptions are not permanent and aim to ensure both electricity supply and public health.",
    "Eskom is reviewing the decision and claims commitment to reducing environmental harm."
