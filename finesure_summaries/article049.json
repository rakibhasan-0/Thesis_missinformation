  "transcript": "Food and farming campaigners urge politicians to support the forthcoming climate and nature bill.\nWith the environment secretary having recently announced plans for a “new deal for farmers” (Report, 8 January), he must also pay close attention to the relationship between climate change and food security. Some 70% of land across the UK is farmed, and together with forestry and fishing, our industries employ 300,000 people.\n\nAny “new deal” must see ministers introduce measures to tackle climate change, restore nature and protect our rich farming heritage for future generations.\n\nOver the past three decades, agricultural emissions have reduced by 12%. Meanwhile, farmers continue to work in harmony with nature, championing conservation and putting food on our tables.\n\nHowever, our way of life is under threat. Climate change has brought rising temperatures, droughts and flooding; all within one agricultural cycle. Without action to tackle emissions and safeguard nature, these events will only multiply.\n\nFarmers must be properly supported to adapt and to become stewards of our land. Taking inspiration from the climate and nature bill, set to be debated on 24 January, is a good start. With 1,700 organisations backing the proposals to boost safeguards for our planet, while reducing emissions, we urge ministers to back it, too, in order to help our farmers adapt and thrive for generations to come.",
