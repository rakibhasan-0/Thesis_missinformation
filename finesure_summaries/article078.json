    "A report by the Environment Agency warns that around 1,100 properties on the East Yorkshire coast could be lost to coastal erosion by 2055, a figure that could rise fivefold without preventive measures.",
    "The region is already among the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe, losing an estimated 14 feet of land each year.",
    "In addition to erosion, over 115,000 properties in Yorkshire and Humber face flooding risks from rivers and the sea, risks expected to increase with climate change.",
    "The report underscores the growing challenge of protecting vulnerable areas amid rising sea levels, more frequent storms, and limited flood defence budgets.",
    "Local communities like Kilnsea are already experiencing the effects, with past losses of land and buildings to the sea.",
    "The Environment Agency plans to release detailed risk maps to help residents understand and prepare for the threats."
