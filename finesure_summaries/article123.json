    "In 2024, carbon dioxide emissions under the EU’s emissions trading system (ETS) dropped by 5%, mainly due to significant reductions in the power sector.",
    "Renewable and nuclear energy production increased while coal and gas usage declined, contributing to a 12% emissions cut in the power sector.",
    "The ETS now covers around 45% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions and has reduced emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels, keeping the bloc on track for its 2030 target.",
    "While industry emissions remained stable, aviation emissions rose 15% due to expanded coverage of international flights.",
    "Maritime emissions were newly included, accounting for 72 million tons of CO2.",
    "ETS carbon prices have declined 25% since January amid broader economic concerns, including trade tensions between China and the U.S."
