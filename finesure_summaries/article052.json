The aim of this experimental new scheme, launched by the waste collection department in the town in north eastern France, was to reduce food waste.\n\nThe project had been in the works for some time. The then-president of Colmar Agglomération (a role similar to a mayor), Gilbert Meyer, had been reelected in 2014 with the slogan \"one family, one hen\", which aimed to encourage residents to adopt a chicken. The following year the operation was launched, in partnership with two nearby chicken farms. Residents were encouraged to think of the free eggs – the effort put into raising a chicken would pay off quickly.\n\nMore than 200 homes in four municipalities signed up and were given two chickens each – either red chickens (Poulet Rouge) or Alsace chickens, an old and local breed.\n\nEach household signed a pledge committing to raising the chickens, with the understanding that the waste department could conduct welfare spot checks on the animals at any time. Henhouses were not provided; it was up to the residents to build or buy their own. The department ensured that each home had enough space for the hens – between 8 and 10 sq m (86 and 108 sq ft).\n\nThe scheme was a success – and is still underway. \"Over the years, other municipalities have joined and since 2022 all 20 municipalities of the agglomération have participated,\" says Eric Straumann, current president of the Colmar Agglomération.\n\nTo date, 5,282 hens have been distributed to local residents, and applications are currently open for the next round of distribution in June 2025. Not only have the residents received a plentiful supply of free eggs, but food waste has also been averted from landfill as chickens are fed kitchen scraps which would otherwise be thrown away.\n\n\"Considering that a hen has a life expectancy of four years on average and that she consumes 150g (5.3oz) of bio-waste per day, we estimate that we have avoided 273.35 tonnes of bio-waste [since 2015],\" says Straumann.\nFood waste contributes more methane emissions to the atmosphere than any other landfilled materials, due to its quick decay rate. In the US, around 58% of methane emissions released into the atmosphere from waste landfills are from food waste. Although shorter-lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane has a global warming impact more than 80 times higher than CO2 over a 20-year period. \n\nAround one third of food produced for humans is lost or wasted globally, amounting to 1.3 billion tonnes per year. Food loss and waste account for 8-10% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions – which is nearly five times the total emissions from the aviation sector.\n\nEven though chicken owners in the UK have been advised to avoid to feeding the birds kitchen scraps due to concerns about spreading disease, it's perfectly legal to do so elsewhere in the world, and it can have a meaningful impact on reducing food waste – and kickstart a cycle that benefits everyone.\n\"Proposed with the aim of reducing food waste, chickens make it possible to promote traditional circular economy practices that are still relevant today, particularly in villages, and which are now developing even in urban areas: chickens fed on our food waste in return provide us with fresh eggs,\" says Straumann.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the chickens can teach children in Colmar about animals and the importance of protecting the natural world, he adds.\nColmar is not the only town to hand out free birds – nor was it the first to do so. In 2012 in another a small north-western French town called Pincé, ­two chickens were offered to each household to help them cut down on organic waste. \"To begin with it was a joke, but then we realised it was a very good idea,\" Lydie Pasteau, the mayor of Pincé, told local media at the time. A total of 31 families were given chickens, along with a bag of feed, with Pasteau calling the scheme a \"surprising\" success. \n\nIn Belgium, chickens have been handed out in the cities of Mouscron and Antwerp and the province of Limburg, although residents had to sign an agreement not to eat the chickens for at least two years. More than 2,500 families adopted hens in one year alone in Limburg, according to some reports, while in Mouscron, 50 pairs of chickens were given out in the second round of the scheme, after the initial giveaway was a success. Residents, who had to prove they had sufficient space in their gardens to keep the birds, were given basic instructions on chicken keeping.\nIn theory, the scheme seems like a good idea, especially in parts of the world where eggs are either in shortage or very expensive. In California or New York, for example, a dozen eggs cost around $9 (£7). As some chicken breeds can lay up to 300 eggs every year, one chicken could lay up to $225 (£178) worth of eggs each year.\n\nIn practice though, Paul Behrens, a professor at the University of Oxford focusing on food systems, says there are some hurdles in the way: \"I'm sure it could be done in the UK but I'm not sure it's a good idea,\" he says. \"Bird flu is an ever-present worry. Current regulations mean you have to keep birds in fenced areas or indoors – this may again be a problem for animal welfare, or even disease spread if people don't do this.\"\n\nThe idea wouldn't work well in the US either, says Mark Bomford, director of Yale University's sustainable food programme. \"I love chickens, but I don't love the sound of this, especially in the US,\" Bomford says.\n\nThe US is currently experiencing an egg shortage due to an outbreak of bird flu – and as a result egg prices have skyrocketed 36% compared to 2023 – but handing out free chickens would not be an \"appropriate\" response, Bomford says.\n\n\"Economically, steep inflation for a basic grocery item like eggs hurts the poor far more than it hurts the rich. To care for chickens you need feed, water, housing, space and free time,\" he says. \"Most people with lower incomes don't have access to these things. By the time you have factored in all these costs, chickens are rarely 'free' and few people realise any net cost savings on eggs.\"\nOne couple, however, did come up with a unique solution – renting chickens. Christine and Brian Templeton of Rent The Chicken in New Hampshire provide hens, feed and support for six months, allowing customers to collect fresh eggs at home. Business, the couple reports, is booming.\n\nIt's important to temper egg expectations though, warns Behrens – industrial birds lay far more eggs than a home-kept healthy bird would. \"Common and modern egg-laying birds are often in huge pain their entire lives, partly due to their genetics which are centred on providing as much 'output' as possible,\" he says. \"If you use older breeds and allow them to live a long, healthy life then you can avoid many of the most egregious animal welfare issues.\"\n\n\"But people should then understand the tradeoff and expectations around that, you are having a much healthier bird in return for fewer eggs,\" he says.\n\nAnd from a food waste perspective, the ideal thing is to simply not waste the food in the first place – some researchers believe that composting can actually increase food waste.\n\n\"They think 'oh, it's okay as we compost',\" says Behrens. \"Which is better than nothing but much worse than not wasting things in the first place. It could be even worse with chickens because you are getting eggs from them. People might waste even more than if they composted.\"\n\nBut one unexpected benefit that was observed in Colmar – that had nothing to do with eggs or food waste – was the community the chickens created. Residents would bond over raising the chickens and would work with neighbours to care for the chickens when they went on holiday. \"Residents have welcomed this operation since its launch,\" says Straumann. \"And that's why all the municipalities in Colmar still participate in our programme today.\"",
