  "transcript": "Human-induced climate change made recent extreme heat in the US south-west, Mexico and Central America around 35 times more likely, scientists say.\n\nThe World Weather Attribution (WWA) group studied excess heat between May and early June, when the US heatwave was concentrated in south-west states including California, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nExtreme temperatures in Mexico also claimed lives during the period.\n\nSuch attribution studies take some time to complete, so it is too soon for scientists to say how much of a role climate change is playing in the current heatwave stretching from the centre of the US through to the north-east and into Canada.\n\nIn their new report, the scientists said such a heatwave was now four times more likely than it was in the year 2000, driven by planet-warming emissions.\n\nMany extreme weather events including heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense as a result of climate change, experts say.\n\n“The results of our study should be taken as another warning that our climate is heating to dangerous levels,\" said Izidine Pinto, Researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.\n\n“Potentially deadly and record-breaking temperatures are occurring more and more frequently in the US, Mexico and Central America due to climate change.\n\n“As long as humans fill the atmosphere with fossil fuel emissions, the heat will only get worse – vulnerable people will continue to die and the cost of living will continue to increase.”\n\nThe WWA study focused on a region including the US south-west and Mexico, as well as Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras which also saw dangerously high temperatures.\n\nThe scientists said that the hottest five-day stretch across the region in June was made about 1.4C warmer by climate change.\n\n“Every fraction of a degree of warming exposes more people to dangerous heat,\" said Karina Izquierdo, Urban Advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at Red Cross Climate Centre.\n\n“The additional 1.4C of heat caused by climate change would have been the difference between life and death for many people during May and June.\"\n\nMexican officials have linked the heatwave to the deaths of scores of people. It has also been blamed for the deaths of howler monkeys in the southern state of Tabasco.\n\nThe scientists underlined the danger from high night-time temperatures - a severe threat to health as the body does not have time to rest and recover.\n\nThe WWA group conducts rapid-attribution studies on weather events around the world to look at the role climate change has played in their severity.\n\nThe scientists examine the events, comparing them against models of what would have likely occurred in a world not subjected to human-induced global warming.",

    "A new study by the World Weather Attribution group finds that human-induced climate change made the recent extreme heatwave in the US southwest, Mexico, and Central America 35 times more likely.",
    "The heatwave, occurring from May to early June, was made 1.4°C hotter by climate change, which significantly increased health risks and contributed to fatalities, including among vulnerable wildlife like howler monkeys.",
    "Scientists warn that as fossil fuel emissions continue, such deadly and record-breaking temperatures will become more common.",
    "The report also highlights the serious danger of high night-time temperatures, which prevent the body from recovering.",
    "Compared to conditions in the year 2000, such heatwaves are now four times more likely due to global warming.",
    "Researchers urge urgent climate action, emphasizing that each fraction of temperature rise increases the threat to human health and life."
