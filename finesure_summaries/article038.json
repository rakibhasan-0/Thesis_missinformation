The rainfall – 400mm (15.7in) recorded in just eight hours – was more than twice the city’s previous record of 175mm (6.8in) set in 1930.\n\nThe sisters, Delfina and Pilar Hecker, were travelling with their parents when their car became trapped in the rising waters. According to reports, a truck driver, named as Rubén Zalazar, attempted to rescue the children before they were swept away. The body of 43-year-0ld Zalazar was found in a lagoon on Sunday.\n\nAt least 16 people have been declared dead by officials, with authorities saying there are “likely to be more”. In the latest press conference, Carlos Bianco, a minister in the Buenos Aires province, said at least 100 people were missing.\n\nAuthorities also said more than 1,000 people were evacuated over the weekend, while estimates suggest hundreds have been made homeless. Videos posted online showed neonatal nurses wading through knee-deep flood waters to rescue newborn babies.\n\n“We looked at the street and saw a river. We saw cars, trucks, containers, everything floating by. You could hear store windows breaking, and see furniture being dragged by the current,” said Soledad Bengochea, 52, a resident. “In one car, we saw two people trapped. It was overwhelming and terrible. There are many people who have suffered.”\n\nThe national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, said the area had been “destroyed”, while Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, declared three days of national mourning.\n\nBut the government has also come under fire after it emerged the national emergency directorate – which provides disaster relief – was shuttered three days before the storm, with 485 employees dismissed or placed on leave. The decision comes as Milei’s administration conducts widespread cuts to state spending.\n\nThe mayor, Federico Susbielles, said that the floods had caused millions in infrastructure damage. Agostina Bitti, a 34-year-old doctor, said there are “still houses under water”. “The entire city needs to be rebuilt,” she said.\n\nArgentina’s economy ministry has pledged AR$10bn (US$9.2m at the official exchange rate) to help repair the damage and rebuild the city.\n\nThe Argentinian footballer Lionel Messi offered his condolences to the victims’ families, saying he wished them strength. Pope Francis, who has been hospitalised in Rome since 14 February, also sent a message to the victims. The Vatican press office said that the pontiff, who is also from Argentina, is holding those affected in his “thoughts and prayers”.\n\nExtreme rainfall has become more common and more intense due to human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, because warmer air can hold more water vapour.",
