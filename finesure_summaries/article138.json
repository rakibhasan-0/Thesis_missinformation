So I guess the question comes down to - what kind of reef do we end up with?\n\n“It won't be like what we have now.”\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is currently a Unesco World Heritage site. Scientists hope that this research could persuade the UN organisation to change its mind and give the reef official “endangered” status.\n\nProf McGregor said this “would send a huge signal to the world about how grave the problem is”.\n\n\"We know what we need to do,” she added. “We have international agreements in place [to limit global temperature rise].\n\n\"I think we just need to put the politics aside and get on with it.\"",

    "Researchers used centuries-old coral cores to trace historical environmental conditions and linked the warming to recent mass bleaching events.",
    "Coral bleaching, caused by extreme heat, leads to the expulsion of algae critical for coral survival, often resulting in coral death if temperatures remain high.",
    "The findings raise concerns that ongoing climate change could permanently alter the reef, which is currently a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
    "Scientists urge stronger global action on climate change and call for the reef to be designated as endangered to highlight the severity of the crisis.",
    "Despite the grim findings, researchers say there is still hope if global warming is limited through collective action."
