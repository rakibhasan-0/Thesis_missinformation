A blaze of fire coral, darting clown fish, crimson sponge, electric blue ray … a turtle! Your heart soars, your head spins. Nowhere else will you encounter such density and diversity of life.\n\nCorals are the architects of all this splendour. Their immobile forms suggest plants, but they’re animals – solar-powered ones. Each is a colony of thousands, sometimes millions, of tiny coral polyps, each resembling a slimmed-down sea anemone, just millimetres tall.\n\nCoral polyps are invertebrates. They protect their delicate bodies by building tiny cups of pure limestone, the building blocks of every reef. Two hundred and fifty million years before our first cities and pyramids rose, corals were already giving free rein to their monumental architectural impulses. No human structure matches the grandeur of the largest reefs. The Great Barrier Reef spans 344,400 sq km, redirecting ocean currents and deflecting tsunamis.\n\nTheir engineering creates niches for millions of other species. These living riches sustain an estimated 1 billion coastal and island dwellers worldwide.\n\nAnd they conjure all this magnificence from virtually nothing: tropical waters are nutrient deserts.\n\nDarwin was the first to wonder how reefs could possibly create so much from so little. The solution to Darwin’s conundrum is that coral polyps don’t weave their magic alone. Their achievements depend on mutually-beneficial symbioses with other reef organisms, particularly invisible microbes. These partnerships are so pivotal that biologists view corals not as individual animals, but as “holobionts” – living collectives where host and microbes function as one.\n\nThe coral holobiont, which narrowly did not on the 10-strong shortlist for the Guardian’s invertebrate of the year 2025, has honed two critical capabilities that allow burgeoning reefs to prosper in watery deserts. First, reefs run on genuinely renewable energy. Photosynthesising algae living inside coral harvest tropical sunlight, funnelling energy into the reef ecosystem.\n\nSecond, coral reefs operate as the ultimate circular economy: nothing wasted, everything re-used. Billions of symbiotic microbes coating the coral’s mucous surfaces recycle nutrients, while also protecting against disease, buffering heat stress and providing essential vitamins.\n\nAnd yet coral polyps are bang on the frontlines of the climate emergency (they are vulnerable to even a small change in temperature) and many scientists now see it as probable, not just possible, that most reefs won’t survive the industrial age. Why? Because we’re changing the oceans too quickly for these adaptable organisms to evolve. A single heatwave can shatter the coral holobiont. Algae jump ship first, bleaching the coral white, before the entire microbiome dissolves into hunger and chaos. Reef ecosystems that took millennia to build can collapse in days.\n\nIn defiance of their apparent fragility, corals have survived multiple mass extinctions during their long evolutionary past. It is, therefore, their amazing successes that offer the most urgent lesson for our increasingly individualistic industrial societies: sustainable flourishing on a finite planet requires collective action. Coral holobionts didn’t conquer nutrient-poor waters through competition, but through cooperation – creating abundance out of extreme scarcity.",
  "summary": "Coral reefs are dazzling ecosystems built by tiny animals called coral polyps, which function in symbiosis with microbes and algae to form holobionts. These holobionts create massive, nutrient-rich reef structures in otherwise nutrient-poor waters, relying on solar energy and an efficient circular economy. The reefs support immense biodiversity and sustain around one billion people globally. However, coral reefs are extremely vulnerable to climate change, with rising ocean temperatures threatening their survival. A single marine heatwave can break down the holobiont system, leading to coral bleaching and ecological collapse. Despite their past resilience, coral reefs now illustrate the importance of collective cooperation for sustainable living in a rapidly changing world."
