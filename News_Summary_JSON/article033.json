  "main_text": "EPA takes aim at almost every major pollution rule in what environmentalists call act of ‘malice toward the planet’.\nDonald Trump’s administration is to reconsider the official finding that greenhouse gases are harmful to public health, a move that threatens to rip apart the foundation of the US’s climate laws, amid a stunning barrage of actions to weaken or repeal a host of pollution limits upon power plants, cars and waterways.\n\nTrump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an extraordinary cavalcade of pollution rule rollbacks on Wednesday, led by the announcement it would potentially scrap a landmark 2009 finding by the US government that planet-heating gases, such carbon dioxide, pose a threat to human health.\n\nThe so-called endangerment finding, which followed a supreme court ruling that the EPA could regulate greenhouse gases, provides the underpinning for all rules aimed at cutting the pollution that scientists have unequivocally found is worsening the climate crisis.\n\nLee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, defended the rollbacks as reducing burdens on industry and consumers, calling it the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.” Environmentalists and former EPA officials condemned the actions, warning they jeopardize public health and the climate.\n\nIn total, the EPA announced 31 regulatory reversals, including the rollback of pollution limits for power plants, vehicles, and waterways. These include weakening Clean Water Act implementation and revisiting air pollution and toxic waste regulations.\n\nThe move has sparked fierce opposition from environmental groups and Democrats, who argue the EPA is abandoning its mission and enabling pollution at the cost of human and environmental health. The administration also plans to eliminate offices focused on environmental justice and halt climate-related grants, actions widely criticized as unlawful and dangerous.\n\nThe Trump administration’s newly formed Energy Dominance Council plans further rollbacks to bolster the fossil fuel industry by removing 20-30% of current regulations.",
  "summary": "The Trump administration has launched a sweeping rollback of climate and pollution regulations, including a proposal to revoke the EPA’s foundational finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health. This move threatens to dismantle key climate protections and follows the announcement of 31 regulatory reversals affecting power plants, vehicles, and water pollution. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin framed the actions as a deregulatory victory, while environmentalists and former officials condemned them as harmful and unlawful. The administration also shut down environmental justice offices and froze billions in climate-related grants. Critics argue these steps undermine decades of progress and endanger public health and the environment. Further rollbacks are expected as part of the administration’s plan to boost the fossil fuel industry through the newly formed Energy Dominance Council."
