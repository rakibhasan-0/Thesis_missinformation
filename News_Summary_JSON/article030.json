  "main_text": "Application, submitted by Cranswick, would have created one of the largest industrial poultry and pig units in Europe.\nA megafarm that would have reared almost 900,000 chickens and pigs at any one time has been blocked by councillors in Norfolk over climate change and environmental concerns.\n\nCouncillors on King’s Lynn and West Norfolk borough council unanimously rejected an application to build what would have been one of the largest industrial poultry and pig units in Europe.\n\nMore than 12,000 objections were lodged against the farm near the villages of Methwold and Feltwell, and 42,000 people signed a petition against it.\n\nObjections came from a local campaign group, NGOs including WWF, Sustain, FeedBack, and the RSPB, as well as the new Labour MP for South West Norfolk, Terry Jermy, and five parish councils. Jermy told the planning meeting on Thursday the intensive farm would threaten local jobs at established farms and businesses, including the vegetarian food giant Quorn, which has a manufacturing site in Methwold.\n\nJake White, head of legal advocacy at WWF UK, told councillors the NGO estimated that the factory farm’s two sites would produce almost 50,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. Over a 20-year lifespan the greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial-style farms would be more than 1m tonnes, he said.\n\nCranswick plc, which provides chicken and poultry to leading British supermarkets, wants to build one of the UK’s largest industrial farms by expanding an existing site to rear 870,000 chickens and 14,000 pigs at any one time.\n\nIn a briefing document submitted in the days before the planning meeting, the company said it wanted to modernise for a growing market, creating more British food to higher welfare standards through the redevelopment of existing farms.\n\nKing’s Lynn and West Norfolk borough council was recommended to reject the application on ecology and climate change grounds by its officers. In a 200-page report, planning officers said the applicant “fails to demonstrate that the development would not result in significant adverse effects on [environmentally] protected sites”.\n\nThere was also “insufficient environmental information to enable the council to reach a view” on its impact on the environment and climate change, the report added. A council lawyer said the company had not provided information on all the likely carbon emissions from the industrial farm and it would be unlawful for councillors to approve the application.\n\nThere are also concerns about air pollution and the impact on a water-depleted area. The Environmental Law Foundation said the farm would need more water than its abstraction licence allowed.\n\nCranswick said the new site was needed to keep up with demand from supermarkets. Barry Lock, managing director for Cranswick in East Anglia, denied claims that the company had plans to export poultry and pork. He said 96% of the food they produced was for British customers. Lock cited food security and increased jobs. He said approving the megafarm would reduce carbon emissions because it would reduce the need for imports of meat from abroad.",
  "summary": "A proposal by Cranswick to build one of Europe’s largest poultry and pig megafarms in Norfolk was unanimously rejected by local councillors due to environmental and climate concerns. The planned facility would have housed 870,000 chickens and 14,000 pigs, producing over 1 million tonnes of CO2 over 20 years. Objections from environmental groups, local communities, and the Labour MP for South West Norfolk raised concerns about air pollution, water usage, and the impact on nearby protected sites. Planning officers found the application lacked sufficient environmental data and warned that approving it would be unlawful. Cranswick argued the farm would improve food security and reduce the need for imports, claiming most of the meat would serve British markets. Despite this, the project faced strong opposition and was halted over its potential ecological and climate impact."
