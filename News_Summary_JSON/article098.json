  "summary": "Southeast Asia is increasingly reliant on fossil fuels to meet rising electricity demand, according to a report by the think tank Ember. In 2023, all of ASEAN’s 3.6% growth in electricity demand was supplied by fossil fuels, while the share of renewable energy declined to 26% due to reduced hydropower output. Carbon emissions in the region rose by 6.6%, with Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines leading in coal use. Ember and the International Energy Agency warn that without significant investment—estimated at $190 billion by 2035—ASEAN countries risk missing climate targets and becoming more vulnerable to energy market fluctuations. Although solar and wind are seen as long-term solutions, institutional and technical challenges, such as energy storage and grid management, hinder rapid adoption. Experts stress the need for a balanced energy transition that ensures both environmental sustainability and economic stability."
