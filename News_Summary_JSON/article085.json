  "headline": "COP29: Will rich nations promise more money for climate change?",
  "main_text": "In 2009, the world's developed nations agreed to give $100bn (£78bn) a year to poorer nations by 2020 to help them tackle and prepare for climate change.\n\nIn the 15 years that have passed since that first goal was set, global temperatures have increased and emissions have grown - requiring trillions of dollars of investment to tackle the issue of climate change.\n\nAt the UN climate summit COP29 this year in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries will recommit to a new goal - but first they must agree how much will be given, who is contributing and how the money will be spent.\n\nWhat do countries want money for?\n\nMoney for climate action broadly falls into three buckets:\n\nLoss and damage\n\nTwo years ago, at COP27, world leaders agreed for the first time to establish a loss and damage fund.\n\nThis money is to help developing countries recover from the effects of climate change they are already suffering.\n\nFor example, in the past 12 months alone the developing world has experienced severe climate-related crises - from flooding in Myanmar to ongoing drought in East Africa.\n\nIt took decades to get this fund established because developed nations were wary of framing the payments as reparations and accepting liability for climate change on these terms.\n\nDeveloping nations would like the new finance target to have sub goals where money is set aside for loss and damage and adapting to climate change - which historically has received a third of the funding of mitigation.\n\nMitigation\n\nThis is money to help developing nations move away from fossil fuels and other polluting activities. This is where most money has been given to date because it can often be profitable.\n\nMany countries still have coal power stations that are yet to reach the ends of their lives. They need support to switch to clean energy, such as solar farms.\n\nAdaptation\n\nThis is money to help developing nations prepare for the worst effects of climate change.\n\nIt is different to loss and damage as it is focused on the future.\n\nThe needs vary depending where in the world the country is, but may include:\n\n    building stronger flood defences\n    relocating populations at risk\n    developing storm proof housing\n    distributing crops that are more resilient to dry spells\n\nWhat has been given so far?\n\nIn 2009, richer countries agreed to provide $100bn (£78bn) a year to developing nations for climate action by the end of 2020.\n\nBut by the end of that year the total was $83.3bn (£65bn) - the goal was finally reached three years later.\n\nThe majority, 82%, of this money came from public funds, with the remainder from the private sector, according to the OECD.\n\nBut analysis, commissioned by the UN, suggests the private sector could deliver 70% of future investments needed to meet climate commitments. A coalition of more than 550 private firms have already committed to use $130tn of assets to help achieve net zero.\n\nOne study in 2018 estimated that developing countries would suffer between $290bn - $580bn (£226bn - £451bn) in damages by 2030, another put the cost at $400bn (£311bn). It is difficult to predict the exact amount, but it is clear the current size of the fund is too small to tackle the issue. \n\nWhat might countries agree in Baku at COP29?\n\nNegotiations on the new quantified goal have been happening for months between governments.\n\nAt the heart of these talks is how much money should be given.\n\nMany studies have tried to put a figure on it - the G77+ China alliance of developing countries has previously said at least $1.3tn (£1.14tn) needs to be mobilised by 2030.\n\nA UN committee on finance tried to combine all these estimates and earlier this year put the number as high as $6.9tn.\n\nIt is unlikely a figure in that region will be announced at Baku. Developed nations including the UK, have recently raised concerns they may not meet their previous pledges because of ongoing domestic economic issues. \n\nAnother key area of discussion is how the money will be given - the majority of the public funding, 69%, is still given in the form of loans rather than direct grants. This can increase the debt burden in poorer nations.\n\nNafkote Dabi, Oxfam International Climate Policy lead, has called this \"profoundly unfair\".\n\nHe said: \"Instead of supporting countries that are facing worsening droughts, cyclones and flooding, rich countries are crippling their ability to cope with the next shock and deepening their poverty.\"\n\nThe third big question on the table is who will contribute. Thirty years ago, it was agreed that developed countries should take on more of the financial burden because of their historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and the economic benefits they enjoyed from exploiting fossil fuels.\n\nBut since then, developing nations like China have grown economically and have a larger carbon footprint. Countries like the US would like China to not just voluntarily give money but be required to.",
  "summary": "At COP29 in Baku, nations are renegotiating climate finance goals as the $100 billion annual pledge made in 2009 has proven insufficient. Funding is needed for three key areas: loss and damage from current climate impacts, mitigation to reduce emissions, and adaptation for future climate resilience. Developing nations seek a more ambitious financial target and fairer distribution, with more grants instead of debt-increasing loans. While past promises fell short, estimates now suggest trillions are needed, with figures ranging from $1.3 trillion to $6.9 trillion by 2030. There is also debate about who should contribute, as emerging economies like China now have significant emissions. Richer countries face pressure to commit more amid global climate disasters and calls for equitable financial support."
