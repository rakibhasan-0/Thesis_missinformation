An “investment portfolio approach” needs to be applied to large-scale tree planting across the world to reduce the risks of the wrong species being planted in the wrong place, economists have said. Countries have made ambitious pledges to plant billions of trees to remove greenhouse gases and tackle global heating. The UK has committed to plant 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of trees each year by 2025 and maintain the rate until 2050, the European Commission has pledged to plant 3bn trees across member states by 2030, and the US under the previous administration committed to planting 1bn trees by the same date. But the types of trees that are needed, and where to plant them, are decisions that have to be made now, though future conditions remain uncertain. The study suggests the risks of future tree planting and the economic risk of its failure could be mitigated by adopting the approach of financial investors, who spread risk across a portfolio of companies by choosing assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities to strike an efficient balance. Environmental economists at Exeter University say there are significant risks of converting farmland to forests in a future of climate change and economic uncertainty, such as large-scale tree planting displacing agriculture and affecting food security, depending on where it takes place. But an “investment portfolio approach” to tree planting, which combines climate risk with economic risk, is the best, most cost-effective way of removing carbon if careful choices are made about which trees to plant where, the researchers said. Frankie Cho, a PhD graduate from the University of Exeter and the lead author of the study, said: “One problem is that, because it is unclear what countries round the world will do to tackle climate change, we don’t know how challenging the climate will be in the future. “If climate change is extreme, broadleaf trees in the southern UK offer the best carbon removal – but that’s prime farmland and could be really costly under certain economic futures. “If climate change is milder, planting conifers on less productive land makes more sense, but those trees will not grow well if conditions are more extreme. The problem is that we don’t know what the future holds and can’t be certain which type of trees we need to plant and where.” Diversifying species and locations for tree planting would minimise the danger of betting on the wrong future, ensuring tree-planting decisions remain resilient in the face of uncertain future climatic and economic conditions, the study, published on Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says. Cho said previous studies have examined the risks posed by either climate or economic variables in isolation, but the risks were inherently interdependent and correlated. The new study took the UK as a model and examined economic risks and climate uncertainties to create a planting portfolio which took both uncertainties into consideration. In the study, the researchers wrote: “Trees of one species are planted in a given location because they tend to give good returns under future conditions in which trees planted in another location give poor returns, and vice versa. “The planting strategy is a portfolio in the sense that it includes planting of both these varieties and thereby limits exposure to downside risk, the possibility of returns falling below a certain threshold.” Brett Day, a professor of environmental economics at the University of Exeter and also an author of the study, said: “We don’t have any other option that can remove carbon from the atmosphere at the scale and cost that we need to meet our net zero targets. While tree-planting carries risks, our study shows that, if done strategically, it remains the best solution we have.”", "sentences": ["A new study recommends applying an 'investment portfolio' strategy to global tree-planting efforts to manage climate and economic uncertainties.", "This approach involves diversifying tree species and planting locations to minimize the risk of poor outcomes under uncertain future conditions.", "The UK, EU, and US have all pledged large-scale tree planting, but future climate and economic conditions could affect which species are most effective.", "Researchers from the University of Exeter argue that integrating both climate and economic risks offers the most cost-effective method of removing carbon.", "The study used the UK as a model, showing that strategic planting can limit the risk of failure by balancing species and sites.", "Despite potential downsides, tree-planting remains the best large-scale solution for carbon removal if approached carefully."]}

Ethical investing has become big business for JP Morgan and other financial giants, with worldwide “sustainable” investing expected to surpass $40tn by 2030. But the industry now faces scrutiny over the rules around investments focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Several of JP Morgan’s “sustainable” funds are investing in the London-listed commodity trader Glencore, which is under fire for its coal operations in South Africa, an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the news website Voxeurop and the Daily Maverick, an online South African news publication, has revealed. JP Morgan’s asset management arm has more than 500 funds promoted as environmental or sustainable investments, ranging from a climate change solutions fund to a global healthcare fund. Under current rules, some of these may still hold investments in firms criticised for environmentally damaging practices. For many of its funds that are promoted as sustainable, JP Morgan specifies that at least 51% of investments must have positive environmental and/or social characteristics. The remaining 49% can be invested without such restrictions. Jakob Thomä, chief executive of ­climate thinktank Theia Finance Labs, said: “The overwhelming majority of retail investors, in my view, would feel misled if they knew that was the ­criteria for labelling something as a sustainable fund.” He said some sustainable funds may be breaking EU law, which says anything that “deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer” is misleading commercial practice. JP Morgan’s sustainable funds also exclude companies that make more than 20% of revenues from thermal coal extraction. Despite being one of the world’s biggest coal companies, Glencore slips under this threshold in terms of revenues. In terms of actual profit, however, coal mining accounts for nearly half. The investments have angered campaigners who have highlighted environmental breaches in Glencore’s operation in South Africa’s coal belt. Glencore runs three mining complexes around the mining town of Phola, Mpumalanga, which is about 70 miles east of Johannesburg. According to a recent South African government report, obtained via a freedom of information request, one of those has been breaking environmental laws since 2017. The company’s Tweefontein coalmine has been accused by the South African water and sanitation department of several breaches including seriously contaminating a local river, storing hazardous waste in open containers and failing to fix broken walls at a sewage facility. Residents at Phola say they don’t trust the local water supply. Daisy Tshabangu, 52, moved to Phola because her family worked at the coal-fired power station that looms on the horizon. “Most of the people, when they do drink this water they get stomach aches,” she said. Phola residents say they feel abandoned by the companies whose mines dominate the landscape. Unemployment is high and infrastructure is crumbling. “We don’t benefit from the mines,” said Tshabangu. “There’s a lot we don’t have but we are surrounded by mines. So to us, it seems like we are being sidelined as a community.” Glencore says that its water treatment plant supplies clean water to Phola as part of its “commitment to sustainable development”. It says it is not directly responsible for the overall supply of water and cannot comment on claims about water quality. It says it has had no complaints via a grievance procedure regarding the supply of water. Despite repeated requests to clean up its operations, the Tweefontein mine was still in breach of multiple environmental laws as recently as November 2023, an inspection report by the South African water and sanitation department reveals. Campaigners question why the company’s licence has not been revoked. “Our regulators are often compromised and give in to the pressure of the coal mining industry. [They] do not have the political will to enforce our laws,” said Mariette Liefferink, chief executive of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment, a local campaign group. Angered that finance promoted as sustainable is supporting Glencore, Liefferink wrote to the former Labour MP Chuka Umunna in November last year about the environmental risk, ecological degradation and pollution associated with JP Morgan’s investments in Glencore. Umunna is now head of sustainable solutions and head of green economy for investment banking at JP Morgan. However, the Observer understands that the former shadow secretary of state for business, who did not respond to the letter, is involved only in the activities of the investment bank, and is not involved in and does not have oversight over the sustainable policies of the asset management arm. Liefferink urged the bank to review its investments in Glencore due to the company’s alleged breaking of environmental laws, as well as the pollution, wildlife damage and environmental risk its activities were causing. Liefferink’s correspondence highlighted two JP Morgan funds with ESG in their name, both of which had millions of pounds invested in Glencore. After a rapid rise in popularity, ESG investing is the subject of increasing scrutiny around the world. Regulators are trying to settle on what it means, and create labels that are easy for investors to understand. The Mpumalanga mines form a small part of Glencore’s global operations. It is the world’s fifth biggest coal miner, selling more than 100m tonnes in 2023 – including from the Cerrejón mine in Colombia where there have been allegations of human rights abuses and environmental destruction. Glencore says it is committed to responsible engagement and the wellbeing of all workers, and that mitigating negative impacts of its mines is imperative to building trust with local communities, which it maintains through ethical and responsible business practices. The company said the water supply in Phola is a municipal service, but that it contributes to a reservoir that also receives water from other sources. It said it monitors the quality of the water provided by its treatment plant on a weekly basis to ensure it is suitable for consumption. The company said it has been taking action in response to Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) inspections since 2017 and that incidents identified in the 2023 audit have been addressed. “Our industrial assets are closely linked to the communities and regions where they operate. We aim to avoid harm to people from our activities, respect human rights, and establish and maintain trusting relationships with stakeholders, through ethical and responsible business practices,” the company said.

Last summer was Australia’s second-hottest on a record going back to 1910, at 1.89C above the long-term average, according to data from the Bureau of Meteorology. The second-hottest summer – coming after the second-hottest winter and the hottest spring on record – included the second-hottest January and the third-hottest December. Only the summer of 2018/19, at 2.11C above average, was hotter. Over the past 15 years, the data shows that only the summers of 2011 and 2001 have been cooler than the long-term average, taken from 1961 to 1990. “Climate change is the primary ingredient for this summer’s heat,” said Dr Linden Ashcroft, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne. “You could not have made this hot summer cake without climate change. It will only get worse if we don’t stop burning fossil fuels. There is no way this could have occurred without a heating planet. Yes, this is the second hottest summer on record, but it will be one of the coolest in the 21st century.” She said the heat had come despite La Niña-like conditions in the tropical Pacific which have in the past been associated with cooler conditions. Data released by the BoM shows the heat was well-spread around the country, with all regions seeing average daily temperatures in the top six on record. Last summer ranked second for the hottest daytime temperatures, and fourth-warmest for night-time heat. On a state-by-state basis, all mainland states had average temperatures in their 10 highest on record for summer. Western Australia had its hottest summer on record, and also its hottest summer for night-time temperatures. Summer rainfall across the country was only slightly below average, with South Australia and the NT particularly dry. “I don’t think we should need convincing about climate change any more in Australia because we can feel it,” said Ashcroft. “We see it in our plants, our weather observations, in our moods and in the decisions that we make. This heat affects people, but we do have the ingredients to stop it.” The bureau’s long-range forecast covering autumn and released this week, showed that most of Australia should expect typical rainfall levels, but north, east and central Queensland could be drier and it could be wetter in the north-west of the country.

The world’s oceans experienced three-and-a-half times as many marine heatwave days last year and in 2023 compared with any other year on record, a study has found. The sustained spike in ocean temperatures cost lives and caused billions of dollars in storm damage, increased whale and dolphin stranding risks, harmed commercial fishing and sparked a global coral bleaching, according to the paper published on Friday in Nature Climate Change. Like heatwaves on land, a marine heatwave is defined as a period of higher than normal temperature over a longer than usual time. The most recent of these were brought about by human-induced climate change and amplified by El Niño conditions, the report’s authors said, with nearly 10% of the ocean hitting record high temperatures in 2023-24. “The more regularly our marine ecosystems are being hit by marine heatwaves, the harder it is for them to recover from each event,” said lead author Kathryn Smith from the UK’s Marine Biological Association. Higher ocean temperatures “supercharge” evaporation, the study said, fuelling storms such as Cyclone Gabrielle which hit New Zealand in February 2023, killing 11 people and costing an estimated NZ$14.5bn (about £6.5bn). One of the most surprising findings in the study, said Smith, was “how much [marine heatwaves] accentuated storms on land and the number of people that were hit by that – hurt, lost possessions, [suffered a] monetary impact or lost their lives”. More worryingly, she said: “There is going to be a huge amount more [about the impacts of marine heatwaves] that we don’t know about [yet] because of the time it takes to publish in scientific literature.” The effect on species was often devastating. Whales and dolphins venture closer to shore when the water is warm because they follow their prey, so this increased their chances of stranding, said Smith. For Mediterranean fan mussels, which have been dying in their millions since 2016, marine heatwaves may be the final nail in the coffin because the warming waters bring increased risk of diseases, the study said. Although human intervention saved some marine life from the recent heatwaves, the study found damage reduction was mostly lacking, possibly due to limited resources, disconnects between organisations and poor communication. When there was time to prepare, successful mitigation actions included moving corals and conches in Florida to deeper, cooler water and keeping endangered Tasmanian red handfish in aquariums until they could be returned to the wild. For corals, the study said initiatives to create new colonies using assisted sexual reproduction that increases genetic diversity showed potential, with increased resilience to bleaching “observed in trial populations of reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Mexico”. Increased ocean temperatures can sometimes bring small wins, the study noted. In Peru, for example, while the anchovy catch was badly affected by the fish moving outside their normal range – a shift that led to commercial fishery closures and estimated losses of $1.4bn (£1.1bn) – squid landings increased. Better forecasting, the study found, is critical to reducing damage from severe marine heatwaves, because it provides “greater confidence” for those making damage limitation decisions. Valeria Pizarro, a scientist at America’s Perry Institute for Marine Science, who was not part of the study, said watching corals bleach “in the blink of my eyes” made her feel “very sad and frustrated”. In most cases, she said, the paper showed effective responses to marine heatwaves were lacking because “we weren’t prepared, we didn’t have the money or the manpower to do much in such a short period of time”. More broadly, said Smith, the direct link between the climate crisis and ocean temperatures means that “until we see a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy”, marine heatwaves, and the damage they do, will continue to increase.", "sentences": ["A recent study published in *Nature Climate Change* reveals that marine heatwave days in 2023–24 were more than triple any previous record, affecting nearly 10% of the world’s oceans.", "These prolonged spikes in ocean temperatures have caused billions in storm damages, increased marine animal strandings, disrupted fisheries, and triggered global coral bleaching.", "The heatwaves, fueled by climate change and El Niño, have made marine ecosystems more vulnerable and less able to recover after each event.", "While some localized mitigation efforts helped, overall response has been hampered by resource constraints and poor coordination.", "Scientists stress the importance of better forecasting and proactive measures to reduce damage.", "The study concludes that unless fossil fuel use is curbed, marine heatwaves and their devastating impacts will only become more frequent and intense."]}

Already fishers are travelling ever further north to catch British favourites such as cod and haddock, and some salmon stocks face extinction. Anchovy, bluefin tuna, sardines, squid and red mullet are already replacing these species and fishers need British consumers’ culinary tastes to change if they are to make a living marketing these new species.

{"doc_id": "article_007", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Climate scientists caution, however, that even weakened currents would cause profound harm to humanity. Vital Atlantic Ocean currents are unlikely to completely collapse this century, according to a study, but scientists say a severe weakening remains probable and would still have disastrous impacts on billions of people. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Amoc) is a system of currents that plays a crucial role in the global climate. The climate crisis is weakening the complex system, but determining if and when it will collapse is difficult. Studies based on ocean measurements indicate that the Amoc is becoming unstable and approaching a tipping point, beyond which a collapse will be unstoppable. They have suggested this would happen this century, but there are only 20 years of direct measurements and data inferred from earlier times bring large uncertainties. Climate models have indicated that a collapse is not likely before 2100, but they might have been unrealistically stable compared with the actual ocean system. The latest study is important because it uses climate models to reveal the reason that the Amoc is more stable: winds in the Southern Ocean continuing to draw water up to the surface and drive the whole system. The study does not rule out an Amoc collapse after 2100, and other modelling research suggests collapses will occur after that time. “We found that the Amoc is very likely to weaken under global warming, but it’s unlikely to collapse this century,” said Dr Jonathan Baker at the UK’s Met Office, who led the latest study. He said it was reassuring that an abrupt Amoc crash was improbable, and that the knowledge could help governments plan better for future climate impacts. Amoc weakening would still bring major climate challenges across the globe however, with more floods and droughts and faster sea level rise, he added. “Of course, unlikely doesn’t mean impossible,” he said. “There’s still a chance that Amoc could collapse [this century], so we still need to cut greenhouse gas emissions urgently. And even a collapse in the next century would cause devastating impacts for climate and society.” Prof Niklas Boers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany said the study delivered a substantial improvement in the understanding of Amoc. “But even a weakening that is not due to a tipping point could have similarly severe impacts on, for example, tropical rains,” he said. “One could even go as far as saying that, in the short term, it doesn’t really matter if we have a strong weakening, say 80%, or a collapse.” The Amoc system brings warm, salty water northwards towards the Arctic where it cools, sinks, and flows back southwards. Global heating, however, is pushing water temperatures up and increasing the melting of the huge Greenland ice cap, which is flooding the area with fresh water. Both factors mean the water is less dense, reducing sinkage and slowing the currents. The Amoc was already known to be at its weakest in 1,600 years as a result of global heating, and researchers spotted warning signs of a tipping point in 2021. The Amoc has collapsed in the Earth’s past, Baker said. “So it’s a real risk.” A collapse of Amoc would have disastrous consequences around the world, severely disrupting the rains that billions of people depend on for food in India, South America and West Africa. It would increase the ferocity of storms and send temperatures plunging in Europe, while pushing up sea levels on the eastern coast of North America and further endangering the Amazon rainforest and Antarctic ice sheets. Scientists have previously said a collapse must be avoided at all costs. The latest study, published in the journal Nature, used 34 state-of-the-art climate models to assess the Amoc. The researchers used extreme conditions – a quadrupling of carbon dioxide levels or a huge influx of meltwater into the North Atlantic – so that the changes in the modelled ocean currents were clear. They found that while the Amoc slowed by between 20% and 80% this century, it did not collapse completely in any of the models. This was because winds in the Southern Ocean continued to draw water up to the surface. Balancing this, to the scientists’ surprise, were new downwelling areas in the Pacific and Indian oceans, but they were not strong enough to wholly compensate for the slowing of the Amoc, leaving it significantly weakened. “Even just a 50% reduction in strength would result in a large drop in heat transport that would alter regional and global climates,” said Dr Aixue Hu at the Global Climate Dynamics Laboratory in Colorado, US. “There is therefore no reason to be complacent about Amoc weakening, and every effort must still be made to combat the global warming that drives it.” Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, an Amoc expert at PIK, said the latest study considered a collapse to be the total cessation of the currents in the North Atlantic, while previous studies have termed a greatly weakened Amoc a collapse. Amoc is partly driven by the sinking of dense water and partly by winds, and the latest study provides particular insights on the latter. “It does not, however, change the assessment of the risk and impact of future Amoc changes in response to human-caused global warming, as that is linked to the [density-driven] part of Amoc,” Rahmstorf said. His own research on post-2100 Amoc collapse, currently under review, concludes “a collapse cannot be considered a low-probability event any more”. Despite the revelations in the latest study, the extent of future Amoc weakening and the timing of any collapse remain uncertain. “There’s a huge amount of work left to do, because there’s still a huge range across models in how much Amoc will weaken,” Baker said, with increasing the resolution of models one important requirement. “We also show that the Southern Ocean and the Pacific Ocean are more important than we thought for Amoc, so we need better observations and modelling in those regions. That’s crucial to improving the projections so we can better inform policymakers,” he said.", "sentences": ["A new study finds that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Amoc), a key climate-regulating ocean current system, is unlikely to collapse entirely this century, though significant weakening remains probable.", "Using 34 advanced climate models, researchers observed that even under extreme conditions, Amoc slowed by 20% to 80% but did not fully cease, largely due to winds in the Southern Ocean sustaining circulation.", "However, scientists stress that even a substantial weakening could bring devastating global effects, including disrupted rainfall, extreme weather, and rising sea levels.", "The study highlights gaps in model resolution and calls for better data collection in critical ocean regions.", "While reassuring in the short term, experts warn that a collapse after 2100 remains a real risk, underscoring the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions.", "Despite some disagreement on the exact definition of “collapse,” the consensus is that any strong decline in Amoc poses serious threats to climate stability and human societies."]}

However, those plans, which were set in 2020, are being pushed out by two decades to 2050. “Progress in reducing emissions in the … supply chain component is proving slower than we anticipated,” HSBC’s annual report said. “We currently expect a 40% emissions reduction across our operations, travel and supply chain by 2030 which would mean that we would need to rely heavily on carbon offsets to achieve net zero in our supply chain by 2030. “As such, we have revisited our ambition, taking into account latest best practice on carbon offsets. We are now focused on achieving net zero in our operations, travel and supply chain by 2050.” HSBC is also proposing to water down environmental targets in Elhedery’s new pay package, including a long-term incentive plan (LTI) worth up to £9m, or 600% of the his base salary. It is part of a wider pay proposal that will give Elhedery a chance to earn up to £15m a year, a 43% increase on his current potential pay of up to £10.5m. The environmental portion of the LTI, a bonus that will cover performance from 2025-27, has been reduced to 20% from 25%. HSBC said this would “ensure a greater proportion of the LTI is aligned to value creation while supporting our ESG (environmental, sustainability and governance) ambitions”. Meanwhile, the LTI will only be linked to progress made in cutting the bank’s own emissions – including those that have been delayed – given that tracking progress of its client base was “difficult”. HSBC’s remuneration committee said in its annual report: “At this stage, financed emission targets remain difficult to include given challenges in the methodology, timeliness and frequency of reporting. This was recognised by the investors we spoke to as part of our policy engagement. “We therefore decided to retain metrics on carbon reduction in our own emissions and sustainable finance and investment, given we cannot currently use financed emissions, which is a material metric in supporting our ESG ambitions.” The pay proposals will be put to shareholders at its annual general meeting this spring. HSBC’s climate target delay prompted criticism from a wide range of environmental campaigners. “HSBC is just putting its feet up and watching the world burn, rather than owning its responsibility for the climate crisis,” Joanna Warrington at Fossil Free London said. “HSBC helped get us into this mess by financing the growth of fossil fuels which drive up emissions, so it has no right complaining that now it’s suddenly too hard to bring them down,” she added. Zahra Hdidou, a senior climate and resilience adviser at ActionAid UK, urged HSBC to “abandon this disastrous delay and stop financing the fossil fuels and agribusiness corporations that are destroying the planet. The time for kicking the can down the road is over.” HSBC announced the decision amid a climate backlash in the US, where the president, Donald Trump, has been encouraging a retreat from environmental policies in favour of support for oil and gas production. The shift has already prompted six of the largest banks in the US – Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – to withdraw from the UN-sponsored net-zero banking alliance (NZBA) in recent weeks. Elhedery said the bank remained committed to a wider net zero goal by 2050 but told journalists it was “reasonable that we take stock of where we are on that journey”. When asked whether he was committed to remaining a member of the NZBA, Elhedery confirmed only that HSBC was, indeed, a member. HSBC confirmed the scale of its cost-cutting drive, with plans to cut $1.5bn (£1.2bn) from its annual costs by the end of 2026, including through an unconfirmed number of job losses across its 220,928 international workforce.

{"doc_id": "article_010", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "And the problem isn’t limited to the region – across the US, nearly a third of new homes are at high risk. The Los Angeles wildfires last month destroyed thousands of homes, killed dozens of people and left a city reeling. They also raised serious questions about the region’s future – and where Americans choose to build. A rapidly increasing share of US homes are built in areas that are at risk of fire. In 1990, about 13% of new homes were built in places at high risk of fire. By 2020, that number had more than doubled to 31%. The numbers come from ClimateCheck, a for-profit research company that compiles risk by studying trends including rainfall, wind and temperature. But the climate crisis is just one of the reasons that more homes are unsafe. The Covid pandemic changed the way people work and live. Some workers who were able to continue their jobs remotely wanted out of dense cities. New York alone has lost half a million residents since 2020. Many of these domestic migrants relocated to smaller cities and rural areas, often choosing homes that were at greater risk of wildfire. Maximilian Stiefel, a risk expert at ClimateCheck, explains: “In California, especially, there’s a difficulty in building dense housing, so a lot of people are forced into single unit housing, and that just accelerates this spread into the wildland urban interface, because you can’t build up another unit on your property if you have a single family house. And then there’s a lot of nimbyism in California, where people don’t want denser developments being built.” Over 80% of properties built in California between 2020 and 2022 were in high fire risk areas, compared with just 28% of the properties built between 1920 and 1929. Insurance companies are well aware of these trends. Experts study data to build “catastrophe models”, predicting how disasters will affect profits. And lately, the numbers haven’t looked good. Two giants from the industry, AllState and State Farm, announced in 2022 and 2023 that they wouldn’t accept any new home insurance applications in California, in large part because of the high risk of wildfire. Meanwhile, the state, which also has its own last-resort insurance program, has engaged in a complex back-and-forth with private companies. LA residents who lost everything – and who are fortunate enough to have insurance – now must grapple with these companies to avert financial disaster. Even for the most rigorous of insurance experts, wildfires are hard to model statistically. Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes or flooding, they are much more dependent on humans. Humans can start them (wildfires spike on the Fourth of July each year) and humans can stop them with better policies such as better funding for fire departments. Despite the key role that humans play in individual wildfires, the rising overall trend in their frequency is clearly attributable to the climate crisis – long periods of drought, strong winds and high temperatures mean that fires spread faster, last longer and cause far more destruction. Even before the latest LA fires, expected to be the costliest ever, nine of the 10 most expensive wildfires in US history had taken place since 2017. Stiefel explains his own personal experience with these numbers: “I lived in Santa Barbara during the Thomas fire, which traveled 30 miles up the coast over three weeks, and we were evacuated.” He says he eventually left California in part because there were “too many hazards there with climate change”. Of course, people have greater mobility when they don’t have dependents, aren’t disabled and don’t have a longstanding attachment to a city. The answer, according to experts like Varun Sivaram, a fellow at the Council for Foreign Relations, is “more stringent building codes and regulations”. Stiefel agrees, noting: “It’s not just about zoning and land use. It’s also about resource sharing and emergency planning, collaboration among all these different levels of government, and educating the community about fire risk.”", "sentences": ["Over 80% of new homes built in California between 2020 and 2022 are in high fire-risk areas, reflecting a national trend where nearly a third of new US homes face similar threats.", "This rise is driven not only by climate change but also by pandemic-induced migration, restrictive housing policies, and preferences for low-density development.", "Insurers like AllState and State Farm have stopped issuing new home policies in California due to increasing wildfire risks, complicating recovery for recent disaster victims.", "Experts stress that wildfires are harder to predict than other natural disasters due to their strong human component, yet climate change is intensifying their frequency and severity.", "Solutions proposed include stricter building codes, better land use planning, and improved public education and emergency preparedness.", "The trend raises concerns about long-term safety and sustainability in vulnerable areas."]}
{"doc_id": "article_011", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Exclusive: Firms outnumber green groups at environmental talks, with related events sponsored by fossil fuel companies. Aviation industry delegates outnumbered those from green groups by 10 to one at the previous conference of the UN’s committee on aviation environmental protection (CAEP), an analysis has found. Other recent meetings held by CAEP’s parent body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), were sponsored by large fossil fuel companies and airlines, including Saudi Aramco and Etihad. Critics accuse the ICAO of having been captured by the industry, resulting in slow efforts to tackle the climate crisis by reducing the carbon emissions from aircraft. The next meeting of CAEP begins on Monday but there is no public information on its agenda or the people who will be running the conference. The ICAO has been criticised for a lack of transparency that contrasts sharply with, for example, the UN’s climate body. The ICAO does not routinely make its meeting documents freely available, instead charging hundreds of dollars for password-protected copies. Neither the media nor the public can attend CAEP conferences, and observer delegates are required to sign non-disclosure agreements that incur “unlimited financial liability”. Flying causes more climate-heating pollution than any other form of transport for every kilometre and is dominated by rich passengers, with 1% of the world’s population responsible for 50% of aviation emissions. The industry’s climate plans are rated “critically insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker. The ICAO forecasts a doubling of passenger numbers by 2042, and the industry argues that more efficient aircraft, sustainable fuels and the ICAO’s offsetting scheme can control carbon emissions. Independent experts say the feasible scale of such measures is extremely unlikely to compensate for such a huge growth in traffic. For example, the “unambitious and problematic” offsetting scheme has yet to require any airline to use a carbon credit and fuel-efficiency improvements are stalling. The experts say aviation growth must be curbed if climate targets are to be met. Lucca Ewbank, the transport lead at InfluenceMap, the thinktank that analysed the delegate data, said: “The level of access and potential influence given to the fossil fuel and aviation industries by ICAO is extremely concerning and risks the capture of global climate negotiations by vested interests. The [lack of] transparency also works in industry’s favour, allowing them to privately influence climate negotiations and push their vested interests without external scrutiny. Industry appears to have exerted significant influence over environmental negotiations at ICAO, resulting in rules that serve the interest of aviation companies at the expense of science-aligned climate action.” Specific technical information on aircraft discussed at CAEP might be commercially sensitive, one delegate told the Guardian, but secrecy should not be “a general rule that governs everything”. The ICAO did not respond to a request for comment. The big CAEP meetings take place every three years and 439 delegates attended the previous event in 2022. Analysis by InfluenceMap showed that 125 (29%) were from the aviation industry, including at least 16 representatives who attended the meeting as part of their national delegations. The latter included delegates from Saudi Aramco, the United Arab Emirate’s national oil company, Adnoc, and its two national airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates, and from Japan Airlines. The International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Associations, which represents manufacturers, provided the most industry delegates, with 62, followed by the Airports Council International (28) and the International Business Aviation Council (10). There were only 11 delegates from environmental groups. In contrast, at the UN’s Cop29 climate summit, only 1.5% of attenders were from the fossil fuel industry or lobbyists. Also unlike UN climate summits, recent ICAO events have been sponsored by industry companies. An ICAO “stocktaking event” on aviation emissions reductions in October 2024 was sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell Aviation, Airbus and the leading trade body for airlines, the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Another ICAO event, on aviation and alternative fuels in Dubai in November 2023, was sponsored by Adnoc, Etihad, Air Arabia and Boeing as well as Shell Aviation, Airbus and IATA. InfluenceMap’s analysis also linked industry figures to influential positions. Kevin Walsh, now vice-president at the trade body Airlines for America, was listed in the report of the 2022 CAEP meeting as being vice-chair for the next CAEP meeting. In 2022, he was part of the US delegation and worked for the Federal Aviation Administration. CAEP has 11 working groups, whose membership is not made public. However, analysis of LinkedIn profiles indicated industry representatives on these groups. Three people from Saudi Aramco were on the fuel task group, as was one from Adnoc, and United Airlines was also represented on working groups. Staff from industry trade bodies were also on working groups, including some from the Airports Council International and IATA. There have been calls for increased transparency, with an unnamed member CAEP highlighting the need for this, according to the report of the 2022 meeting. Another delegate, also unnamed, said “transparency is the lifeblood of effective governance”, focusing on “improving access, broadening participation, and ensuring accountability”. The US delegation called publicly for greater transparency in 2022, saying this would “improve [CAEP’s] accountability to the public it seeks to serve” and that other UN bodies released all papers for decision meetings publicly and in advance of meetings.

The climate crisis drove weeks of high temperatures in the west African region responsible for about 70% of global cacao production, hitting harvests and probably causing further record chocolate prices, researchers have said. Farmers in the region have struggled with heat, disease and unusual rainfall in recent years, which have contributed to falling production. The decline has resulted in an increase in the price of cocoa, which is produced from the beans of the cacao tree and is the main ingredient in chocolate. A new report found that “climate change, due primarily to burning oil, coal and methane gas, is causing hotter temperatures to become more frequent” in places such as the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria. The study, by the independent research group Climate Central, found the trend was particularly marked in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the two biggest cacao producers. Using data from 44 cacao-producing areas in west Africa and computer models, the researchers compared today’s temperatures with a counterfactual of a world not affected by global heating. The researchers looked at the likelihood of these regions facing temperatures in excess of 32C (89.6 F) – above levels considered optimum for cacao trees. The report calculated that over the last decade, global heating had added an extra three weeks of temperatures exceeding 32C in Ivory Coast and Ghana during the main growing season between October and March. Last year, the hottest year globally on record, they found global heating drove temperatures above 32C on at least 42 days across two thirds of the areas analysed. Researchers said “excessive heat can contribute to a reduction in the quantity and quality of the harvest”. Many other factors were potentially harming cacao trees and boosting prices, they noted, including mealybug infestations, rainfall patterns, smuggling and illegal mining. Christian Aid published separate research this week on the vulnerability of chocolate and cacao farmers to weather changes driven by global heating. The UK charity said conditions in west Africa had changed dramatically due to extreme rainfall and spoiled crops during the dry season in 2023 and the drought in 2024. “Growing cocoa is a vital livelihood for many of the poorest people around the world and human-caused climate change is putting that under serious threat,” said Osai Ojigho, the director of Christian Aid’s policy and public campaigns. Failed harvests had helped drive a significant rise in cocoa prices since late 2023 on the London and New York markets where the commodity is traded. New York cocoa prices were more than $10,000 a tonne on Wednesday, below a peak of more than $12,500 in mid-December. New York prices have largely hovered between $2,000 and $3,000 a tonne for decades. In January, the Swiss chocolate maker, Lindt & Sprüngli, said it would raise prices again this year to offset rising cocoa costs. Narcisa Pricope, a professor at Mississippi State University, said the crop faced an “existential threat” largely because of increasingly dry conditions in cacao-producing regions. Pricope was part of recent research from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification that found more than three-quarters of the Earth’s landmass had become drier over the past 30 years. The emissions of greenhouse gases were the biggest cause of this aridity, she said, but practices that degraded soils and nature also played an important role. “Collective action against aridity isn’t just about saving chocolate – it’s about preserving the planet’s capacity to sustain life,” she said.", "sentences": ["Climate change is severely impacting cacao production in West Africa, the region responsible for about 70% of the world’s supply, leading to falling harvests and record-high cocoa prices.", "A study by Climate Central found global heating has added three extra weeks of extreme heat during the growing season in countries like Ivory Coast and Ghana, reducing crop yields and quality.", "Additional stressors include disease, irregular rainfall, and illegal activities such as smuggling and mining.", "Cocoa prices have surged above $10,000 per tonne, prompting companies like Lindt to raise product prices.", "Separate research by Christian Aid and the UN highlights how climate-driven aridity threatens not just chocolate, but global food systems and livelihoods.", "Experts urge coordinated action to combat the drivers of land degradation and protect vulnerable communities and ecosystems."]}

The world’s peatlands are “dangerously underprotected” despite the colossal amount of climate-heating carbon dioxide already being emitted due to their destruction, a study has warned. Peatlands occupy just 3% of all land, but contain more carbon than all of the world’s forests. However, farmers and miners are draining the peatlands, releasing so much CO2 that if they were a country, they would be the fourth biggest polluter in the world after China, the US and India. The first global assessment found that only 17% of the peatlands were within protected areas. This contrasted starkly with other valuable ecosystems such as tropical forests, where 38% were protected, and mangroves (42%). Protection was even lower than the 17% average in the three nations with the most peatlands: Canada, Russia and Indonesia. The US and Brazil completed the top five nations, which contained almost three-quarters of all peatlands, and had higher proportions in protected areas. But the researchers cautioned that protected status on a map did not always translate to strong protection on the ground. The scientists said conserving and restoring peatlands was essential to keeping global heating below internationally agreed targets and limiting the damage to lives and livelihoods. Almost a quarter of peatlands are under heavy pressure from human activities. However, action to defend peatlands was a cost-effective way of tackling the climate crisis, the researchers said, and a quarter were within Indigenous peoples’ lands, which have been shown to suffer less environmental degradation than elsewhere. Peatlands were “ultra-high-value ecosystems”, said Dr Kemen Austin at the Wildlife Conservation Society, who led the study – but levels of protection were “dangerously low”. Peatlands not only store carbon, but also trap water, helping to prevent floods and droughts, and harbour many mosses and flowers, birds, fish and butterflies. “Their value for people, both locally and at the global scale, is just enormous,” she said. “The carbon in peatlands took hundreds to thousands of years to accumulate and cannot be replaced on timescales relevant to climate change action,” Austin said. “That’s why peatlands are sometimes referred to as a carbon bomb, because once you ignite that bomb, those emissions are going to continue, and we’re not getting that carbon back.” However, because peatlands are a very carbon-dense ecosystem, “the bang for the buck is really high when we think about protecting them”, she said. Peatlands, also called bogs, fens, swamps, mires and muskeg, are wetlands where dead plant matter accumulates and decomposition is slow due to the material being waterlogged. However, draining or disturbing peatlands for farming, mining or roads and other infrastructure exposes the carbon to the air and leads to CO2 being released into the atmosphere. In total, the carbon stored in peatlands is equivalent to more than half a century’s worth of current global emissions. The study, published in the journal Conservation Letters, analysed the proportion of peatlands that were in various types of protected areas. While 17% were in some kind of protected area, only about half of that was considered strictly protected. In the Republic of the Congo, almost 90% of peatlands fell within protected areas, but less than 1% had strict protection. In the UK, which ranked 12th in the world by area of peatland, 41% fell in protected areas. Along with Indonesia, the UK was one of the few countries to have a comprehensive peatland strategy to support its national climate plans, the researchers said. However, about 80% of the bogs in the UK were already degraded by draining, overgrazing and burning. The researchers said expanding protected areas was important for safeguarding peatlands but that the management and financing of existing protected areas had to improve as many were poorly funded. Environmental regulations that protected land from damaging exploitation would also help, as would improving the land rights of Indigenous peoples, especially where peatland protection was being linked to the selling of carbon credits. There are also important opportunities in 2025 to add peatland protection and restoration to national climate and biodiversity plans that countries must submit to UN bodies. Prof Chris Evans, at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the study was important: “Peatlands are often overlooked, not helped by the fact that they are typically flat, wet, often inaccessible, not always picturesque and, unlike forests, the gigatonnes of carbon they hold are hiding below the surface.” He said even peatland now being farmed could be improved by reducing the depth of drainage, a measure that had the potential to reduce global emissions by about 2% while keeping the land in agricultural use. Prof Heiko Balzter, at the University of Leicester in the UK, said: “There is a risk we might lose the peatland carbon sink.” He said the heatwaves and droughts being worsened by global heating itself also threatened the viability of peatlands: “That is one more reason to protect them quickly.”", "sentences": ["Peatlands, covering just 3% of Earth’s land, hold more carbon than all forests combined, yet only 17% are protected, making them a critical but neglected climate asset.", "A new global study warns that their ongoing destruction—especially in countries like Canada, Russia, and Indonesia—is releasing vast amounts of CO2, contributing significantly to climate change.", "Peatlands are often drained for farming and mining, exposing stored carbon to the atmosphere, and if left unchecked, could make keeping climate goals impossible.", "Despite their immense value for carbon storage, flood prevention, and biodiversity, protections are often weak or poorly enforced.", "Experts stress that safeguarding and restoring peatlands, particularly through Indigenous land rights and improved regulation, is a highly cost-effective way to mitigate climate change.", "The study urges countries to include peatland conservation in their 2025 climate and biodiversity plans, emphasizing that rapid action is needed to prevent irreversible damage."]}

Just over a month since devastating wildfires broke out across southern California, the fundraising platform GoFundMe has raised more money for victims of the fires than for all other natural disasters worldwide last year. To date, more than a million donors in all 50 states and 160 countries have donated more than $250m to support fire relief and recovery efforts, about $20m more than GoFundMe collected after all other disasters last year, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton. That includes donations to individual families and businesses, as well as non-profits providing relief on the ground, including Direct Relief, World Central Kitchen and Salvation Army, according to a spokesperson for the company. Although private insurers and the government are still supporting the majority of rebuilding costs, the potency of private fundraisers like GoFundMe has increasing significance as the frequency of climate-related disasters increases – and as Donald Trump threatens to close the federal agency tasked with disaster relief. Private fundraising has drawn criticism for perpetuating inequities – that is to say, people with wealthy social networks are apt to receive more support than their lower income peers. According to two University of Washington researchers, on average, Black and Latino families displaced by the Los Angeles wildfires had raised thousands less than the average for all those using the fundraising platform following the fires. In an effort to combat those inequalities – especially after the Eaton fire ravaged the predominantly Black neighborhood of Altadena – GoFundMe also randomizes which fundraisers appear across its website, including on its California Wildfires centralized hub. The company is also working with the organizers of spreadsheets to amplify fundraisers for Black, Latino and AAPI families, for educators and for those with disabilities. Through GoFundMe.org, the company has also begun a Wildfire Relief Fund, where it has distributed 5,500 emergency cash grants, prioritizing those who have received less money or not yet reached their fundraising goals. Private fundraisers – including millions donated by celebrities, athletes and companies – are taking on increasing significance in disaster response as federal agencies come under fire. The US president began his criticism of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) after Hurricane Helene demolished large swaths of red-leaning North Carolina last October, saying the agency had spent money on “illegal migrants” instead of Republican voters. After visiting North Carolina and California during his first week in office last month – where he called the agency “a disaster” – he ordered a review of Fema’s operations. Although Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally shutter Fema, he has already supported withholding federal disaster funds from California. On social media and in media appearances, Trump has criticized California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom – who’s been at the forefront of efforts to resist Trump’s immigration and abortion agendas – over state water policy. Trump and congressional Republicans have called for disaster aid to California to be conditioned on the state approving a plan to deliver more water to the agricultural and red-leaning Central valley. Though it will take months – if not years – to rebuild parts of Los Angeles, families like Ryan and Endea Marrone say the support they’ve received on platforms like GoFundMe has been life altering. “It was like the worst day in the world,” Ryan said. “And then once [the GoFundMe and messages] started, it was like: ‘Oh my gosh, this is so hopeful.’ It took away a little bit of the pain.”", "sentences": ["GoFundMe raised over $250 million for victims of the Los Angeles wildfires, surpassing all donations for other global disasters in the previous year.", "More than a million donors from 160 countries contributed, aiding families, businesses, and nonprofits involved in relief efforts.", "While private fundraising has provided crucial support, it has also faced criticism for reinforcing social inequalities, as lower-income and minority families raised significantly less on average.", "To address this, GoFundMe implemented randomization and partnered with organizers to amplify underrepresented fundraisers.", "The growing role of private fundraising comes amid federal disaster aid uncertainties, especially as former President Trump criticizes FEMA and threatens to cut funding to California.", "Despite the challenges, recipients of GoFundMe support, like the Marrone family, have found hope and relief through the platform."]}

A major new report on New Zealand’s environment has revealed a worrying outlook for its unique species and highlighted declining water health, while also noting some improvements in air quality. The ministry of the environment’s three-yearly update, Our Environment 2025, collates statistics, data and research across five domains – air, atmosphere and climate, freshwater, land, and marine – to paint a picture of the state of New Zealand’s environment. James Palmer, the ministry’s secretary for the environment, said the findings in the report were a “mixed bag”. “It does highlight the real risks to people, communities and places, which left unaddressed threaten our livelihoods and our quality of life for generations to come,” Palmer said. “But the report also shows that there are reasons for optimism.” The report painted a sobering picture for New Zealand’s indigenous animals, with 76% of freshwater fish, 68% of freshwater birds, 78% of terrestrial birds, 93% of frogs, and 94% of reptiles threatened with extinction or at risk of becoming threatened. “New Zealand’s unique biodiversity has a high proportion of threatened or at-risk species – one of the highest amid the global biodiversity crisis”, the report said, noting that land use, pollution, invasive species and climate change can all have an impact on biodiversity. The report also found the most widespread water quality issue affecting groundwaters was the presence of E coli – a bacteria found in the guts of animals and humans that can cause serious illness and has been linked to farming and cities in New Zealand. Of more than 1,000 groundwater monitoring sites, nearly half failed to meet the drinking water standard for E coli on at least one occasion between 2019 and 2024, while nearly half of the monitored rivers shows worsening E coli trends. Meanwhile, a significant proportion of groundwaters have accumulated excess nitrate due to activities such as intensive farming, logging and urbanisation, which also affects water quality and degrades surface water ecosystems. Dr Mike Joy, a senior research fellow in freshwater ecology and environmental science at Victoria University of Wellington, said the report revealed the ongoing and – in most cases – worsening decline of the environment. “The report reveals starkly the fallacy of the label ‘clean green New Zealand’ and the urgent need for this to be taken seriously by government,” he said. New Zealand also faced a significant problem with pest plants. “The most spectacular of those, arguably, is the wilding conifer,” Palmer said. Around 2m hectares are thought to be invaded by wilding conifers, an introduced pest plant that spreads from plantation forests. Their area is expanding by around 90,000 hectares a year and, without proper management, could invade about a quarter of New Zealand’s land within 30 years, the majority of which would be conservation land. The report traverses how New Zealanders will be affected by the climate crisis and the increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as Cyclone Gabrielle in 2023. Around 750,000 people and 500,000 buildings, are near rivers and in coastal areas already exposed to extreme flooding, while low-lying communities are vulnerable to sea-level rise, and rural communities are at risk of wildfires. “We’ll face some tough choices about our priorities as a country, including about where we put our efforts and our scarce dollars,” Palmer said. The report identified some environmental improvements, particularly in air quality. While road transport remains the main source of nitrogen oxide pollution, air pollution from motor vehicles was reducing due to stronger emission standards, more people choosing to use lower-emission vehicles, and improvements to engines and fuel. “We’ve started to turn the corner in meaningful ways on some of our measures – choices about the cars we drive, the heating we use for our homes, for example, are showing up in better air quality, which is likely to flow through into better health,” Palmer said. “That underscores that we can make a difference, and we can build on the momentum that is already underway by doing more.”", "sentences": ["New Zealand's 2025 environmental report highlights alarming threats to biodiversity, with the majority of native freshwater and terrestrial species at risk of extinction.", "The report also reveals deteriorating water quality, with widespread E.", "coli and nitrate contamination linked to agriculture and urbanization.", "Additionally, invasive wilding conifers are rapidly spreading, posing a major risk to conservation land.", "The report underscores growing climate-related threats, such as extreme weather, flooding, and sea-level rise, which endanger hundreds of thousands of residents and structures.", "Despite these concerns, there are signs of improvement, particularly in air quality, attributed to stricter vehicle emissions standards and cleaner technologies.", "Officials stress the urgency of addressing environmental decline while acknowledging progress in areas like pollution control as a foundation for future action."]}

Drax burns wood to generate about 8% of the UK’s “green” power, and 4% of overall electricity. This is classed as “low-carbon” because the harvested trees are replaced by others that take up carbon from the atmosphere as they grow. But many studies have shown that wood burning harms the environment, by destroying forests, and because of the decades-long time lag between the immediate release of carbon dioxide CO2 from burning and the growth to maturity of replacement trees. Drax currently receives billions of pounds in subsidies from energy bill payers, at the rate of about £2m a day according to Greenpeace, but these are scheduled to run out in 2027. A government decision on whether to continue the support payments beyond the cut-off could come as soon as Monday. Campaigners fear that ministers could allow Drax unrestricted subsidies for continuing to burn biomass, which one said would be “incredibly bad news”. A further option would be to impose strict time limits on the subsidies, or require Drax to use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which could reduce the harm to the climate but still allow widespread destruction of trees. Awarding new subsidies to Drax would be highly controversial among Labour MPs. The Guardian has seen letters from parliamentarians sent to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Reporting Council, querying Drax’s claims to environmental sustainability. Several peers and at least one MP have asked the financial regulators to open an investigation into Drax, based partly on findings from the energy regulator, Ofgem, that the company had misreported data on the origins and sustainability of imported wood pellets. Research last month from the green thinktank E3G found the government could meet its target of decarbonising the UK’s electricity sector by 2030 without Drax. Matt Williams, senior advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the Drax decision a crucial test of the government’s green plans. “If [ministers] award business-as-usual subsidies, that would be incredibly bad news for forests, and anyone who cares about them. Billions more for the UK’s single largest polluter would make it clear the government was placing all its bets on high-carbon infrastructure,” he said. “But if they put limits on the time or the quantity of subsidies, that would indicate the government was thinking twice about this, and could signal the beginning of the end [for biomass subsidies].” The row over Drax is the latest in a series of controversies that campaigners warned risked giving the impression that Labour was sacrificing its green credentials in the pursuit of economic growth. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has given the green light to a new runway at Heathrow, and some allies are thought to want her to give the go-ahead to the massive new Rosebank oilfield in the North Sea. A Whitehall source said the Treasury was not involved in decisions over Drax. Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “For burning wood to be genuinely green [it] needs a lot of very specific requirements that Drax has not achieved. Continuing to subsidise huge biomass imports would not be a step towards a cleaner future, but a dirty compromise with past failures.” He added: “This government stood on a manifesto to deliver clean power by 2030, and to tackle the climate emergency. Whether it’s Heathrow’s third runway or potential permitting of new oil and gas developments, the government’s commitment to stopping climate change is starting to look a little frayed around the edges. More biomass at Drax would be yet another decision that is likely to make the climate and nature crises worse, not better.” The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser on the climate, is likely to address the issue of burning biomass for power in its advice on the seventh carbon budget, which will be published on 26 February. Previous advice has strongly warned ministers to abandon biomass burning for power, unless equipped with CCS. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “The situation we inherited for large scale biomass generators was unacceptable. When energy prices spiked as a result of Putin’s weaponisation of gas supplies, some biomass generators made excessive profits. We are considering this issue carefully - we want a sensible solution that delivers for billpayers and we will provide an update shortly.” A spokesperson for Drax refused to comment on future subsidies. He said the company had previously announced it could be using CCS from the early 2030s.", "sentences": ["Green campaigners are raising alarms over a potential extension of billions in UK government subsidies to the Drax power station, which burns wood for electricity and is currently classified as 'low-carbon.", "' Critics argue that burning biomass is environmentally harmful due to deforestation and delayed carbon reabsorption, and that Drax has failed to meet strict sustainability requirements.", "Existing subsidies, amounting to £2 million per day, are set to expire in 2027, but a decision to renew them could come imminently.", "While some suggest limiting subsidies or requiring carbon capture and storage (CCS), environmental groups and MPs question Drax's environmental claims and call for investigations.", "Research indicates that the UK could meet its clean energy targets without Drax, and continued support may damage the government’s climate credibility.", "The issue adds to broader concerns about the UK’s green agenda, as other recent decisions also appear to prioritize economic growth over environmental commitments."]}

Marine heatwaves linked to the deaths of 30,000 fish off the Western Australia coast were up to 100 times more likely to occur because of climate change, new research has found. Waters off WA have been affected by prolonged marine heatwaves since September. Regions off the north-west coast were hottest, with ocean temperatures 1.5C higher than average over a five-month period and sometimes 4C to 5C higher at the surface. Analysis by the non-profit group Climate Central found climate change had made the marine heatwave 20 times more likely to occur – and the most affected period in November 100 times more likely. Heatwave conditions are triggered when an area is hotter than 90% of recorded temperatures for that time of year over at least five consecutive days. Dr Andrew Pershing, the chief program officer at Climate Central, which has adapted climate attribution methods for studying major weather events on land to the ocean, said the escalating heat seen off the coast of WA was “not a normal event”. “This is an event that is directly tied to burning fossil fuels,” he said. The group’s Ocean Climate Shift Index drew on satellite data from organisations including the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and applied 13 climate models, to isolate the effect of carbon pollution from human activities, Pershing said. Nearly 90% of marine heatwaves were now attributable to human-caused global heating and are expected to increase in frequency, intensity and duration as fossil fuel emissions continue to rise, previous studies have found. Marine heatwaves caused “prolonged thermal stress” to marine life, which authorities say probably contributed to the mass fish kill observed at beaches along WA’s Pilbara coast. Australia was “on the frontline” of these effects, Pershing said. These events led to fish kills and coral bleaching and had widespread consequences for industries including fishing and tourism. A marine heatwave off the WA coast in 2010-11 damaged more than a third of seagrass meadows in Shark Bay. Dr Matt Rayson, an oceanographer at the University of Western Australia, who was not involved in the attribution study, said the heat that began building in the north in September had slowly crept down into the western side of Australia, with the ocean getting warmer at the surface. Autonomous ocean robots, deployed by the university, had also measured temperatures below the surface, finding unusual levels of heat. Rayson said 90% of the extra energy trapped by greenhouse gases was stored in the ocean, increasing the probability of ocean heatwaves. As well as effects on marine life, this additional energy could translate into severe weather events including tropical cyclones. WA’s unusual marine heat was continuing to escalate. In January, ocean temperatures were consistently at least 1.6C hotter than average, according to Climate Central. Pershing said marine heatwaves weren’t random. They were connected to climate change, he said, and becoming more intense and frequent as humans continued to pollute the atmosphere. “Humans are affecting the planet in a lot of ways. We’re used to thinking of how it affects us on land, but it’s affecting everything on the planet, and the ocean is such a huge part of our planet.”", "sentences": ["A recent study has found that climate change made the marine heatwaves off Western Australia—linked to the deaths of 30,000 fish—up to 100 times more likely, especially during the peak in November.", "Using satellite data and 13 climate models, Climate Central concluded that global heating has significantly increased the likelihood and severity of ocean heatwaves.", "These prolonged temperature spikes, sometimes up to 5°C above average, are causing thermal stress to marine life and disrupting ecosystems.", "Experts say 90% of the excess heat from greenhouse gases is stored in the ocean, heightening the risk of marine heatwaves and related weather events like tropical cyclones.", "The warming seas are not isolated incidents but are directly tied to fossil fuel emissions, with Australia being particularly vulnerable.", "The findings highlight the urgent need to address oceanic impacts of climate change, which affect biodiversity, fisheries, and coastal communities."]}
{"doc_id": "article_018", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Prof James Hansen says pace of global heating has been significantly underestimated, though other scientists disagree. The pace of global heating has been significantly underestimated, according to renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, who said the international 2C target is “dead”. A new analysis by Hansen and colleagues concludes that both the impact of recent cuts in sun-blocking shipping pollution, which has raised temperatures, and the sensitivity of the climate to increasing fossil fuels emissions are greater than thought. The group’s results are at the high end of estimates from mainstream climate science but cannot be ruled out, independent experts said. If correct, they mean even worse extreme weather will come sooner and there is a greater risk of passing global tipping points, such as the collapse of the critical Atlantic ocean currents. Hansen, at Columbia University in the US, sounded the alarm to the general public about climate breakdown in testimony he gave to a UN congressional committee in 1988. “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) defined a scenario which gives a 50% chance to keep warming under 2C – that scenario is now impossible,” he said. “The 2C target is dead, because the global energy use is rising, and it will continue to rise.” The new analysis said global heating is likely to reach 2C by 2045, unless solar geoengineering is deployed. The world’s nations pledged in Paris in 2015 to keep global temperature rise below 2C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C. The climate crisis has already supercharged extreme weather across the world with just 1.3C of heating on average in recent years destroying lives and livelihoods – 2C would be far worse. Prof Jeffrey Sachs, also at Columbia University, said: “A shocking rise of warming has been exposed by, ironically, a reduction of pollutants, but we now have a new baseline and trajectory for where we are.” Climate scientist Dr Zeke Hausfather, who was not part of the study, said it was a useful contribution. “It’s important to emphasise that both of these issues – [pollution cuts] and climate sensitivity – are areas of deep scientific uncertainty,” he said. “While Hansen et al are on the high end of available estimates, we cannot say with any confidence that they are wrong, rather that they just represent something closer to a worst-case outcome.” In the new study, published in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen’s team said: “Failure to be realistic in climate assessment and failure to call out the fecklessness of current policies to stem global warming is not helpful to young people.” They said the IPCC analysis was heavily reliant on computer models and that the complementary approach they took of making more use of observations and climate analogues from the distant past was needed. The world has seen extraordinary temperatures over the last two years. The primary cause is the relentless rise in CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The peak of the El Niño climate cycle in 2024 added an extra temperature boost. However, these two factors do not fully explain the extreme temperatures, or their persistence after the El Niño ended in mid-2024. This left puzzled climate scientists asking if there was a worrying new factor not previously accounted for, or if the extra heat was an unusual but temporary natural variation. A key focus has been on emissions from shipping. For decades, the sulphate particles produced by ships burning fuel have blocked some sunlight from reaching the Earth’s surface, suppressing temperatures. But in 2020, new anti-pollution regulations came into force, sharply cutting the level of the aerosol particles. This led to more heat from the sun reaching the surface, which scientists measure as watts per square metre (W/m2). Hansen’s team’s estimate of the impact of this – 0.5W/m2 – is significantly higher than five other recent studies, which ranged from 0.07 to 0.15 W/m2, but would explain the anomalous heat. Hansen’s team used a top-down approach, looking at the change in the reflectivity over key parts of the ocean and ascribing that to the reductions in shipping emissions. The other studies used bottom-up approaches to estimate the increase in heat. “Both approaches are useful and often complementary,” said Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “But I think in this case, Hansen’s approach is too simple and doesn’t factor in changes in Chinese emissions, or internal variability.” The new study also argues that the planet’s climate sensitivity to rising carbon emissions has been underestimated, partly because of the underestimation of the impact of reduced shipping emissions. Climate sensitivity is defined by scientists as the temperature rise that would result from a doubling of CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Again, Hansen’s team have used a different method to most scientists and come up with a higher estimate. The IPCC, a collaboration of the world’s climate scientists, found that the computer models that best reproduce past temperatures have a climate sensitivity of 2.5C to 4C. Hansen’s team took a simpler approach, calculating the potential range in temperature rises for a doubling of CO2 and then using data on how much heat the Earth has trapped to estimate the most likely climate sensitivity. Their estimate is 4.5C. Cloud formation, which is affected by global heating and aerosol pollution, is a key source of the uncertainties. Anomalously high temperatures have continued in January 2025, which set a new record for the month and confounded expectations that temperatures would drop with the current La Niña, the cooler part of the El Niño cycle. “This unexpected record may presage higher temperatures this year than many of us thought,” said Hausfather. Hansen’s group also argues that the accelerated global heating they predict will increase ice melting in the Arctic. “As a result, shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) is likely within the next 20-30 years, unless actions are taken to reduce global warming – in contradiction to conclusions of IPCC. “If Amoc is allowed to shut down, it will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several metres – thus, we describe Amoc shutdown as the ‘point of no return’.” The central estimate of another recent study on the timing of an Amoc collapse was 2050. However, Hansen said the point of no return could be avoided, based on the growing conviction of young people that they should follow the science. He called for a carbon fee and dividend policy, where all fossil fuels are taxed and the revenue returned to the public. “The basic problem is that the waste products of fossil fuels are still dumped in the air free of charge,” he said. He also backed the rapid development of nuclear power. Hansen also supported research on cooling the Earth using controversial geoengineering techniques to block sunlight, which he prefers to call “purposeful global cooling”. He said: “We do not recommend implementing climate interventions, but we suggest that young people not be prohibited from having knowledge of the potential and limitations of purposeful global cooling in their toolbox.” Political change is needed to achieve all these measures, Hansen said: “Special interests have assumed far too much power in our political systems. In democratic countries the power should be with the voter, not with the people who have the money. That requires fixing some of our democracies, including the US.”", "sentences": ["Renowned climate scientist James Hansen argues that the international goal of limiting global warming to 2°C is no longer feasible due to underestimated climate sensitivity and the warming effects of reduced shipping pollution.", "His study suggests Earth could reach 2°C of warming by 2045, increasing the likelihood of tipping points such as the collapse of Atlantic ocean currents.", "Hansen criticizes current climate policies and proposes urgent actions, including a carbon fee-and-dividend system, rapid nuclear energy expansion, and further research into solar geoengineering.", "While some scientists find his predictions high-end, they acknowledge the worst-case scenarios are plausible.", "The study also emphasizes that anti-pollution regulations may have unintentionally accelerated warming by reducing sulfate aerosols that previously blocked sunlight.", "Hansen concludes that political reform is essential for empowering citizens to demand meaningful climate action."]}

The Greenland ice sheet – the second largest body of ice in the world – is cracking more rapidly than ever before as a response to climate breakdown, a study has found. Researchers used 8,000 three-dimensional surface maps from high-resolution commercial satellite imagery to assess the evolution of cracks in the surface of the ice sheet between 2016 and 2021. They found that the crevasses – the wedge-shaped tears that open in glaciers – had significantly increased in size and depth over the five years and at a faster rate than previously detected. “The biggest thing I was surprised about was how fast this was happening. One previous study showed changes over the scale of decades … and now we’re showing this happening on scales of five years,” said Dr Tom Chudley, an assistant geography professor at Durham University and lead author of the study. Since 1992, Greenland has been behind about 14mm of sea level rise. According to scientists, this is due to the increased melting of ice in response to hotter weather, and the increased flow of ice in the ocean as a response to hotter ocean temperatures, both driven by climate breakdown. “We are confident that crevasses opening are related to the speed-up of the ice sheet. We’ve known for a number of years now that the ice sheet’s been accelerating quite significantly since 1990, and broadly we understand this to be related to ocean warming,” said Chudley. He hopes the high resolution mapping used in the study will begin to feed into other research in order to better project sea level rise. “Several of our large-scale models struggle to account for a lot of what we call dynamic instabilities,” he said. “These are things related to the glacier moving and getting faster … dynamic instabilities are causing potentially up to a metre of sea level rise by 2100, and 10 metres of sea level rise by 2300. “So, we desperately need to be better able to project sea level rise, because we need to be able to plan, to mitigate and adapt to sea level rise over the next three centuries.”", "sentences": ["A new study by Durham University reveals that the Greenland ice sheet is cracking faster than ever, with crevasses significantly increasing in size and depth between 2016 and 2021.", "Using high-resolution satellite data, researchers found that these changes are occurring over just five years—much faster than previously observed.", "The cracking is closely linked to the accelerating movement of the ice sheet, driven by rising air and ocean temperatures due to climate change.", "Since 1992, Greenland has contributed approximately 14mm to global sea level rise.", "Lead author Dr.", "Tom Chudley emphasizes that improved understanding of these rapid dynamic changes is crucial for more accurate projections of future sea level rise.", "Current models may underestimate the risk, with potential sea level increases reaching up to one meter by 2100 and 10 meters by 2300."]}

The world is on track for disastrous global heating – but this will create profits for some air conditioning companies, according to forecasts by leading Wall Street financial institutions. Recent reports by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and the Institute of International Finance all make clear the finance sector considers the Paris climate agreement limiting global temperatures, signed a decade ago by nearly 200 nations, is effectively dead and investors should plan accordingly. “We now expect a 3C world,” states a March analysis by Morgan Stanley. This level of global heating above preindustrial times is well beyond the 2C limit agreed to by governments and would lead to catastrophic heatwaves, floods, economic strife and other upheavals. The Morgan Stanley investor research forecasts, though, that multiplying heatwaves will provide a windfall for companies that provide air conditioning, and that the global market could grow by 41% to be worth $331bn by the end of this decade. The analysis outlines several dozen air conditioning businesses around the world that are likely to profit from a hotter world. “Progress on climate change is likely to fall short of net-zero targets,” the report states. “We expect cooling – critical to human health and productivity in many climates – to be a potent long-term growth theme.” The skepticism of top Wall Street firms over climate targets is shared by many other analysts, including at the United Nations, who have predicted that the Paris goals are wildly off-track due to persistently high greenhouse gas emissions. The parlous trajectory of the climate crisis has been underscored by the return of Donald Trump as US president. Trump has called climate change “a giant hoax”, withdrawn the US from the Paris treaty and set about dismantling environmental rules designed to limit harmful pollution. Banks, too, have shown signs they are scaling back their climate concerns. Since December, the six biggest US banks – JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs – have all quit a group called the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which sets responsible banking practices to meet climate goals. “We are clearly seeing a broad retreat on climate from the finance sector,” said Paddy McCully, senior analyst at Reclaim Finance, a group that pushes financial firms to act on the climate crisis. “It is to a very large extent being influenced by Trump and his agenda of accelerating climate change, although also due to banks using Trumpism as an excuse to roll back commitments that they had never actually intended to keep.” Morgan Stanley’s investor research on air conditioning is “mind numbingly cynical”, McCully said. “Especially as it comes just months after they first weakened their decarbonization targets and then quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance.” Morgan Stanley’s report does acknowledge that surging deployment of air conditioning, primarily in wealthier countries, is not a panacea in a hotter world. If powered by fossil fuels, air conditioning use itself causes more planet-heating emissions that will further raise global temperatures. “Morgan Stanley Research does not provide firm views, we assess evidence provided by experts such as those developed by the scientific community,” said Stephen Byrd, global head of sustainability research at Morgan Stanley. I would not characterize our view being that ‘climate change brings many upsides’. I would instead suggest that we will see large volumes of capital deployed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and cooling (among other products, such as smart power grids) would be one such category of increased capital allocation.” As the world warps from higher temperatures, some businesses have eyed opportunities such as shipping routes through a previously ice-bound Arctic Ocean. This motivation, as well as the valuable minerals being exposed for mining as ice retreats, is thought to be part of Trump’s rationale for wanting to annex Greenland. “This is a bit like saying the quiet part out loud,” said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, about the banks’ forecasts. Wagner said that there is “lots of greenhushing”, the opposite of greenwashing, now occurring among corporations. “Indeed, the world won’t stay below 1.5C of warming, largely because we’re already there,” Wagner said of the Paris deal’s most ambitious stretch target. Last year was the first individual year, globally, to top 1.5C of heating. “And yes, that means that climate risks will get worse before they get better,” he said. “That much is clear.

{"doc_id": "article_021", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Experts say previous economic models underestimated impact of global heating – as well as likely ‘cascading supply chain disruptions’. Economic models have systematically underestimated how global heating will affect people’s wealth, according to a new study that finds 4C warming will make the average person 40% poorer – an almost four-fold increase on some estimates. The study by Australian scientists suggests average per person GDP across the globe will be reduced by 16% even if warming is kept to 2C above pre-industrial levels. This is a much greater reduction than previous estimates, which found the reduction would be 1.4%. Scientists now estimate global temperatures will rise by 2.1C even if countries hit short-term and long-term climate targets. Criticisms have mounted in recent years that a set of economic tools known as integrated assessment models (IAM) – used to guide how much governments should invest in cutting greenhouse gas emissions – have failed to capture major risks from climate change, particularly extreme weather events. The new study, in the journal Environmental Research Letters, took one of the most popular economic models and enhanced it with climate change forecasts to capture the impacts of extreme weather events across global supply chains. Dr Timothy Neal, of the University of New South Wales’s Institute for climate risk and response and the lead author of the study, said the new research had looked at the likely impact of global heating of 4C – seen by many climate experts as catastrophic for the planet – finding it would make the average person 40% poorer. This compared with about 11% poorer when using the models without enhancements. Previous economic models that “inadvertently concluded” even high levels of global heating would have only modest impacts on the global economy had “profound implications for climate policy”, Neal said. He said economic models had tended to only account for changing weather on a local level, rather than how weather extremes like droughts or floods could affect global supply chains. “In a hotter future, we can expect cascading supply chain disruptions triggered by extreme weather events worldwide,” Neal said. Prof Andy Pitman, a climate scientist at UNSW and co-author of the research, said: “It’s in the extremes when the rubber hits the road. It isn’t about average temperatures.” “Retooling economic models to account for extremes in your part of the world and its impact on supply chains feels like a very urgent thing to do so countries can fully cost their economic vulnerabilities to climate change and then do the obvious thing – cut emissions.” Some economists have argued global losses from global heating might be partially balanced by warming that could benefit some cold regions, such as Canada, Russia and northern Europe. But Neal said global heating would hit countries everywhere, because global economies are linked by trade. Prof Frank Jotzo, a climate policy expert at Australian National University who was not involved in the research, said economic climate modelling using IAMs assumed that if climate change made an activity such as agriculture unviable in one part of the world, increased output would simply come from somewhere else. “The result is that the models say that climate change makes little difference to the future world economy, which is contrary to what physical impact science and a nuanced understanding of interdependencies in the economy would suggest.” A report in January from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, representing the profession that underpins the risk management decisions of the world’s insurers and pension funds, said previous economic risk assessments had failed to account for real-world climate impacts like “tipping points, extreme events, migration, sea level rise, human health impacts or geopolitical risk.” “The benign but flawed results may reinforce the narrative that these are slow-moving risks with limited impacts, rather than severe risks requiring immediate action,” the report said. Mark Lawrence researches climate risk as a professor of practice at the University of Adelaide and previously worked in financial risk management with senior roles at major financial institutions including Merrill Lynch and ANZ Banking Group. He said the results of the new research were credible. “If anything, I believe the economic impacts [of climate change] could be even worse,” he said. A consequence of the disconnect between modelling and real-world climate impacts, Lawrence said, was that “the potential economic benefits of urgent climate policy action have also been significantly understated”.", "sentences": ["New research from Australian scientists reveals that global warming of 4°C could make the average person 40% poorer, significantly more than previous estimates.", "Even a 2°C rise could reduce global per capita GDP by 16%, highlighting flaws in existing economic models that underestimate the impact of climate change.", "The study enhanced a popular economic model to include extreme weather events and their cascading effects on global supply chains.", "Critics argue that traditional integrated assessment models overlook these interconnected risks, leading to inadequate climate policies.", "Experts emphasize that economic harms will be global due to trade dependencies and that urgent retooling of economic forecasting is needed.", "The findings also suggest that the benefits of aggressive climate action have been seriously understated in current policymaking frameworks."]}

A blaze of fire coral, darting clown fish, crimson sponge, electric blue ray … a turtle! Your heart soars, your head spins. Nowhere else will you encounter such density and diversity of life.\n\nCorals are the architects of all this splendour. Their immobile forms suggest plants, but they’re animals – solar-powered ones. Each is a colony of thousands, sometimes millions, of tiny coral polyps, each resembling a slimmed-down sea anemone, just millimetres tall.\n\nCoral polyps are invertebrates. They protect their delicate bodies by building tiny cups of pure limestone, the building blocks of every reef. Two hundred and fifty million years before our first cities and pyramids rose, corals were already giving free rein to their monumental architectural impulses. No human structure matches the grandeur of the largest reefs. The Great Barrier Reef spans 344,400 sq km, redirecting ocean currents and deflecting tsunamis.\n\nTheir engineering creates niches for millions of other species. These living riches sustain an estimated 1 billion coastal and island dwellers worldwide.\n\nAnd they conjure all this magnificence from virtually nothing: tropical waters are nutrient deserts.\n\nDarwin was the first to wonder how reefs could possibly create so much from so little. The solution to Darwin’s conundrum is that coral polyps don’t weave their magic alone. Their achievements depend on mutually-beneficial symbioses with other reef organisms, particularly invisible microbes. These partnerships are so pivotal that biologists view corals not as individual animals, but as “holobionts” – living collectives where host and microbes function as one.\n\nThe coral holobiont, which narrowly did not on the 10-strong shortlist for the Guardian’s invertebrate of the year 2025, has honed two critical capabilities that allow burgeoning reefs to prosper in watery deserts. First, reefs run on genuinely renewable energy. Photosynthesising algae living inside coral harvest tropical sunlight, funnelling energy into the reef ecosystem.\n\nSecond, coral reefs operate as the ultimate circular economy: nothing wasted, everything re-used. Billions of symbiotic microbes coating the coral’s mucous surfaces recycle nutrients, while also protecting against disease, buffering heat stress and providing essential vitamins.\n\nAnd yet coral polyps are bang on the frontlines of the climate emergency (they are vulnerable to even a small change in temperature) and many scientists now see it as probable, not just possible, that most reefs won’t survive the industrial age. Why? Because we’re changing the oceans too quickly for these adaptable organisms to evolve. A single heatwave can shatter the coral holobiont. Algae jump ship first, bleaching the coral white, before the entire microbiome dissolves into hunger and chaos. Reef ecosystems that took millennia to build can collapse in days.\n\nIn defiance of their apparent fragility, corals have survived multiple mass extinctions during their long evolutionary past. It is, therefore, their amazing successes that offer the most urgent lesson for our increasingly individualistic industrial societies: sustainable flourishing on a finite planet requires collective action.

The damage at 3C will be so great that governments will be unable to provide financial bailouts and it will be impossible to adapt to many climate impacts, said Thallinger, who is also the chair of the German company’s investment board and was previously CEO of Allianz Investment Management.\nThe core business of the insurance industry is risk management and it has long taken the dangers of global heating very seriously. In recent reports, Aviva said extreme weather damages for the decade to 2023 hit $2tn, while GallagherRE said the figure was $400bn in 2024. Zurich said it was “essential” to hit net zero by 2050.\n\nThallinger said: “The good news is we already have the technologies to switch from fossil combustion to zero-emission energy. The only thing missing is speed and scale. This is about saving the conditions under which markets, finance, and civilisation itself can continue to operate.”\n\nNick Robins, the chair of the Just Transition Finance Lab at the London School of Economics, said: “This devastating analysis from a global insurance leader sets out not just the financial but also the civilisational threat posed by climate change. It needs to be the basis for renewed action, particularly in the countries of the global south.”\n\n“The insurance sector is a canary in the coalmine when it comes to climate impacts,” said Janos Pasztor, former UN assistant secretary-general for climate change.\n\nThe argument set out by Thallinger in a LinkedIn post begins with the increasingly severe damage being caused by the climate crisis: “Heat and water destroy capital. Flooded homes lose value. Overheated cities become uninhabitable. Entire asset classes are degrading in real time.”\n\n“We are fast approaching temperature levels – 1.5C, 2C, 3C – where insurers will no longer be able to offer coverage for many of these risks,” he said. “The math breaks down: the premiums required exceed what people or companies can pay. This is already happening. Entire regions are becoming uninsurable.” He cited companies ending home insurance in California due to wildfires.\n\nThallinger said it was a systemic risk “threatening the very foundation of the financial sector”, because a lack of insurance means other financial services become unavailable: “This is a climate-induced credit crunch.”\n\n“This applies not only to housing, but to infrastructure, transportation, agriculture, and industry,” he said. “The economic value of entire regions – coastal, arid, wildfire-prone – will begin to vanish from financial ledgers. Markets will reprice, rapidly and brutally. This is what a climate-driven market failure looks like.”\nNo governments will realistically be able to cover the damage when multiple high-cost events happen in rapid succession, as climate models predict, Thallinger said. Australia’s disaster recovery spending has already increased sevenfold between 2017 and 2023, he noted.\n\nThe idea that billions of people can just adapt to worsening climate impacts is a “false comfort”, he said: “There is no way to ‘adapt’ to temperatures beyond human tolerance … Whole cities built on flood plains cannot simply pick up and move uphill.”\n\nAt 3C of global heating, climate damage cannot be insured against, covered by governments, or adapted to, Thallinger said: “That means no more mortgages, no new real estate development, no long-term investment, no financial stability. The financial sector as we know it ceases to function. And with it, capitalism as we know it ceases to be viable.”\n\nThe only solution was to cut fossil fuel burning, or capture the emissions, he said, with everything else being a delay or distraction. He said capitalism must solve the crisis, starting with putting its sustainability goals on the same level as financial goals.\n\nMany financial institutions have moved away from climate action after the election of the US president, Donald Trump, who has called such action a “green scam”. Thallinger said in February: “The cost of inaction is higher than the cost of transformation and adaptation. If we succeed in our transition, we will enjoy a more efficient, competitive economy [and] a higher quality of life.”", "sentences": ["Günther Thallinger of Allianz SE warns that the escalating climate crisis threatens to dismantle capitalism by making large parts of the financial sector unviable.", "As temperatures rise, insurance companies are increasingly unable to provide coverage, making mortgages, investments, and other financial services unsustainable.", "Thallinger highlights that entire regions are becoming uninsurable, posing a systemic risk to financial stability and economic development.", "Without rapid reduction of fossil fuel emissions, governments will be unable to cover the damages from frequent, extreme climate events.", "At 3°C of warming, adaptation becomes impossible, leading to the collapse of markets and key societal structures.", "Thallinger calls for capitalism to prioritize sustainability alongside profit to prevent widespread market failure."]}

The world is on track for disastrous global heating – but this will create profits for some air conditioning companies, according to forecasts by leading Wall Street financial institutions. Recent reports by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and the Institute of International Finance all make clear the finance sector considers the Paris climate agreement limiting global temperatures, signed a decade ago by nearly 200 nations, is effectively dead and investors should plan accordingly. “We now expect a 3C world,” states a March analysis by Morgan Stanley. This level of global heating above preindustrial times is well beyond the 2C limit agreed to by governments and would lead to catastrophic heatwaves, floods, economic strife and other upheavals.The Morgan Stanley investor research forecasts, though, that multiplying heatwaves will provide a windfall for companies that provide air conditioning, and that the global market could grow by 41% to be worth $331bn by the end of this decade. The analysis outlines several dozen air conditioning businesses around the world that are likely to profit from a hotter world.“Progress on climate change is likely to fall short of net-zero targets,” the report states. “We expect cooling – critical to human health and productivity in many climates – to be a potent long-term growth theme.”The skepticism of top Wall Street firms over climate targets is shared by many other analysts, including at the United Nations, who have predicted that the Paris goals are wildly off-track due to persistently high greenhouse gas emissions.The parlous trajectory of the climate crisis has been underscored by the return of Donald Trump as US president. Trump has called climate change “a giant hoax”, withdrawn the US from the Paris treaty and set about dismantling environmental rules designed to limit harmful pollution.Banks, too, have shown signs they are scaling back their climate concerns. Since December, the six biggest US banks – JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs – have all quit a group called the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which sets responsible banking practices to meet climate goals.“We are clearly seeing a broad retreat on climate from the finance sector,” said Paddy McCully, senior analyst at Reclaim Finance, a group that pushes financial firms to act on the climate crisis.“It is to a very large extent being influenced by Trump and his agenda of accelerating climate change, although also due to banks using Trumpism as an excuse to roll back commitments that they had never actually intended to keep.”Morgan Stanley’s investor research on air conditioning is “mind numbingly cynical”, McCully said. “Especially as it comes just months after they first weakened their decarbonization targets and then quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance.”Morgan Stanley’s report does acknowledge that surging deployment of air conditioning, primarily in wealthier countries, is not a panacea in a hotter world. If powered by fossil fuels, air conditioning use itself causes more planet-heating emissions that will further raise global temperatures.“Morgan Stanley Research does not provide firm views, we assess evidence provided by experts such as those developed by the scientific community,” said Stephen Byrd, global head of sustainability research at Morgan Stanley.“I would not characterize our view being that ‘climate change brings many upsides’. I would instead suggest that we will see large volumes of capital deployed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and cooling (among other products, such as smart power grids) would be one such category of increased capital allocation.”As the world warps from higher temperatures, some businesses have eyed opportunities such as shipping routes through a previously ice-bound Arctic Ocean. This motivation, as well as the valuable minerals being exposed for mining as ice retreats, is thought to be part of Trump’s rationale for wanting to annex Greenland.“This is a bit like saying the quiet part out loud,” said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, about the banks’ forecasts. Wagner said that there is “lots of greenhushing”, the opposite of greenwashing, now occurring among corporations.“Indeed, the world won’t stay below 1.5C of warming, largely because we’re already there,” Wagner said of the Paris deal’s most ambitious stretch target. Last year was the first individual year, globally, to top 1.5C of heating.“And yes, that means that climate risks will get worse before they get better,” he said. “That much is clear.

The UK’s carbon emissions fell by 4% last year, according to official figures. Provisional statistics published on Thursday by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) show UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions were 371m tonnes carbon equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2024, down from 385 MtCO2e in 2023. Emissions were 54% lower than they were in 1990, DESNZ said. Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Doug Parr, gave a guarded welcome to the announcement. “This good news is the latest demonstration that the UK’s efforts to tackle climate change are working, despite what some politicians on the right might try and make you believe,” he said. He noted though that while emissions were falling, the UK was still dependent on “expensive and polluting gas” for energy. “This is driving up the cost of household energy bills, controlling the price of electricity and leaving us beholden to gas-exporting countries who may not have our best interests at heart,” he said. “The government must put a stop to the great gas rip-off, and rapidly make renewables the backbone of our energy system to lower our bills for good.” DESNZ said “decreased gas and coal use in the electricity supply and industry sectors” had driven the fall in emissions, with electricity supply emissions down 15% and industrial emissions down 9%. The closure of the UK’s last coal-fired power station in September and an expansion in renewable energy played a significant role, officials said, as did higher electricity imports and the winding down of blast furnaces for the steel industry. The largest source of emissions continued to be the transport sector, which accounted for 30% of the total, but a fall in the use of diesel-powered cars on the UK’s roads led to a 2% fall, according to the statistics. Emissions from the buildings and product use sector – the second most significant, accounting for 21% of the total – rose by 2% “due to higher gas use likely driven by an easing of energy and other cost pressures”, according to officials. Ironically, climate change may also have contributed to the fall. “Above average temperatures and fewer heating degree days since 2022 has kept residential buildings emissions down relative to earlier years,” the statistical release said. “If weather conditions for both 2023 and 2024 had followed long-term trends, there would have been a 4% increase in residential buildings emissions estimates.”The estimates cover seven gases which contribute to a “greenhouse effect” in the earth’s atmosphere – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride. CO2 made up about 78% of the 2024 total.

{"doc_id": "article_027", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "The film, combined with The Little Mermaid, created more carbon emissions than some major airports do in a year. At a screening of the new Snow White movie in London last month, influencers walked through an artificial fairytale forest, complete with a full-size thatched cottage filled with models of furry animals. In the US, Disney paraded an actual bunny in a brown knitted jumper down the red carpet at the film’s Hollywood premiere. But the film’s theme of being at one with nature seems not to have extended to the real-life environment, with company documents showing the making of Snow White generated more greenhouse gas emissions in the UK than the latest Fast & Furious film, despite the latter’s reliance on an array of gas-guzzling cars. Analysis of more than 250 sets of filings from the Walt Disney Company reveals that the live action remakes of Snow White and another animated classic, The Little Mermaid, created more pollution than any of its other movies made in the UK since 2019, when the environmental reporting requirement was introduced. It obliges companies to disclose the emissions generated in the UK, so the global total may be higher. The Little Mermaid, for example, was also filmed in Sardinia, while the Fast and Furious film-makers travelled to Italy and the US. The combined emissions for Snow White and The Little Mermaid are higher than the annual amount produced by Birmingham and Luton airports. Each movie generated higher emissions than the annual total for Blackpool Pleasure Beach and London’s O2 Arena, where the Snow White influencer event took place. Snow White is the latest live-action Disney film and stars West Side Story actor Rachel Zegler in the leading role and Wonder Woman’s Gal Gadot as the evil queen. It has been far from a fairy­tale for the company, plagued by controversy about everything from the outspoken politics of the lead actor to the role of the seven dwarves. The film is reportedly on track to make a loss of about $115m (£89m), with total takings of just $145m against a cost of about $260m. Despite being made by an American studio, both Snow White and The Little Mermaid were filmed at Pinewood Studios, just outside London. Studios filming in the UK get up to 25.5% of their spending reimbursed under government plans to incentivise the industry. As part of this process, accounts must be filed for the ­production company behind each movie, showing the cost of making the movie and the emissions generated in the UK. These accounts show that by the end of 2023, Disney had received £44.9m in return for making Snow White in the UK and £49.7m for The Little Mermaid. Emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) and are divided into three categories, known as scopes. The first one covers emissions from fuel directly used to produce the movie, for example by generators powering cameras and heaters. The second scope covers emissions generated by the creation of the electricity used during production. Scope three shows indirect emissions which are generated by suppliers of goods and services. Scope three emissions are largely outside the control of the companies being measured, so many, including airports, don’t list them on their accounts. Scope three for airports includes emissions from the planes that use them, so if this were included they would have a much higher total than films. In scope one and two Snow White generated 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The Little Mermaid generated 5,127 tonnes, to give a combined total of 8,279.6 tonnes. This compares with 7,829 tonnes for Birmingham airport in 2023-24, 6,243 for Luton in 2023 and 3,351 for East Midlands in 2023-24, according to their latest data. Major productions are known in the movie industry as “tentpoles”. A source close to Disney said last year that a total of around 2,600 tCO2e “is right in line for what the emissions for a tentpole production should be”. The Little Mermaid is double that (taking into account all three scopes) and Snow White is 62% higher. The latter was filmed extensively on location, which increases the need for portable generators. Fuel for these accounted for the majority of the energy usage during the making of both movies, though it could have been higher. This is because the movie-makers used battery-powered generators and hybrid ones partly powered by batteries.\n\nThey also tapped into mains power when possible and the accounts add that the “electricity supply at Pinewood was switched to a renewable supply via a green tariff in 2020 (reductions from this switch are not included in these calculations)”. They also state that production staff rented electric cars and “charter flights were only used for full crew moves where they are less carbon intensive than booking hundreds of commercial flights”", "sentences": ["Disney’s live-action remakes of *Snow White* and *The Little Mermaid* produced more carbon emissions in the UK than the latest *Fast & Furious* film, with their combined emissions surpassing annual totals from major airports like Birmingham and Luton.", "*Snow White* alone generated over 3,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, while *The Little Mermaid* added more than 5,000, far exceeding typical benchmarks for large-scale productions.", "Despite being made by an American studio, both films were shot in the UK and benefited from significant government subsidies.", "The high emissions were mainly due to fuel use for portable generators and other production activities, though efforts were made to mitigate the impact using battery-powered equipment and green electricity.", "Disney’s environmental disclosures follow UK reporting requirements but exclude global emissions, suggesting the actual total could be even higher.", "The report adds to controversies surrounding *Snow White*, which has underperformed financially and faced public backlash."]}

We actually see a modest increase in GDP growth, that may look small at first … but quickly grows.”\n\nSimon Stiell, the UN climate chief, also warned in a speech on Wednesday morning in Berlin that Europe would suffer economic devastation from the climate crisis, if strong action were not taken soon. Extreme weather would shave 1% from Europe’s GDP before mid-century, and by 2050 would shrink the economy by 2.3% a year.\n\nAlthough those figures may appear small, the crucial point is that the economic contraction would continue year after year. For comparison, the financial crisis of 2008-09 caused a contraction of 5.5% in the EU, but recovery began within a few years. The contraction owing to the climate crisis would be the equivalent of a serious recession occurring every year.\n\nBy the end of two decades of such damage, the EU economy would cease to exist.\n\n“[Climate breakdown] is a recipe for permanent recession,” said Stiell. “As disasters make more and more regions unliveable, and food production declines, millions more people will be forced to migrate, internally and across borders.”\n\nHe added: “The climate crisis is an urgent national security crisis that should be at the top of every cabinet agenda.”\nCritics of the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 have complained that tackling the climate crisis, by switching from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy, would stifle economic growth and cripple the global economy.\n\nHowever, the costs involved in investing in renewable energy are relatively modest, compared with the likely damage. In the UK, the cost is likely to be 0.2% of GDP a year to 2050. Providing climate finance to the poor world would also benefit rich countries.\n\nData from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), published on Wednesday, found record-breaking growth last year of 15% in renewable energy capacity.

So that trade-off between short-term defence needs now, versus the long-term need to prevent this bigger fight on climate change, is absolutely needed.\n\n“[Whether] we should put climate into the defence budget or not, each country will decide,” she added. “Climate is a bigger battle, not of one country but humanity.”\n\nGermany’s coalition agreement, signed last week, includes €100bn (£85bn) to be spent on the climate over the next 12 years, alongside massively increased defence spending, achieved by removing the country’s longstanding “brake” on increasing debt.\n\nThe UK has taken an opposing tack, slashing overseas aid and threatening to cut the budget for Great British Energy, the national renewable energy champion, in order to pay for increased defence spending while staying within the “fiscal rules” self-imposed by Rachel Reeves, the chancellor.\n\nToni, an economist by training who has previously worked in civil society roles, spoke out against the UK’s move, which many experts have warned could reduce developing countries’ capacity to tackle the climate crisis.\n\n“Obviously, it’s not a good signal,” she said. “We need to understand that signal, and what type of consequences those signals have.”\nAlongside the Azerbaijan government, which hosted Cop29, Brazil is working on a roadmap to show how developed countries could meet the pledge made last year of devoting $300bn (£230bn) a year to climate finance for the poor world by 2035.\n\nEd Miliband, the UK energy and net zero secretary, concluded a three-day visit to China on Monday. Toni predicted that the US’s turn away from climate action under Trump would not weaken China’s efforts to cut carbon.\n\n“There is no vacuum in leadership, and Chinese companies are really going forward with the decarbonisation process, because they realise it is very good for their own economy,” she said.\n\nAll countries have agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” she said, so she expected China to address that issue in its national plan, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nDeveloping countries could use their NDCs as investment plans, to attract private and public sector cash from overseas, she added. “We are hoping that the NDC becomes part of a social and economic plan of development.

It was signed by 195 environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, Earthjustice and Sunrise Movement; legal non-profits including the American Association for Justice and Public Justice; and dozens of other organizations.\n\nOver the last decade, states and municipalities have brought more than 30 lawsuits accusing big oil of intentionally covering up the climate risks of their products, and seeking potentially billions in damages. The defendants have worked to kill the cases, with limited success.\nNow, with Republicans in control of the White House and both congressional chambers, advocates fear the industry will go further, pursuing total immunity from all existing and future climate lawsuits. To do so, they could lobby for a liability waiver like the one granted to the firearms industry in 2005, which has successfully blocked most attempts to hold them accountable for violence.\n\n“Lawmakers must decisively reject any attempt by the fossil fuel industry to evade accountability and ensure both justice today and the right of future generations to hold polluters responsible for decades of deception,” said the missive, which is addressed to the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, and Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer.\n\nFossil fuel companies have vied for such a get-out-of-jail-free card for years. In 2017, a coalition of Republican officials, economists and oil companies proposed legal liability as a condition of a carbon tax, arguing the industry could not weather both. When the council abandoned the waiver proposal two years later, Exxon threatened to leave the group, documents subpoenaed by the Senate show.\n\nThen, in 2020, a waiver was quietly included in a draft of a Covid-19 spending package but was later removed, the investigative climate outlet Drilled found.\n\nSuch a waiver could only pass through the Senate with supermajority support, requiring backing from some Democrats. In a January interview, Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert at Columbia University, said it is “hard to imagine” it winning bipartisan backing. But the advocates fear oil companies could lobby officials to once again quietly tuck the proposal into a larger, must-pass piece of legislation.\n\n“Democrats need to be on guard,” said Aaron Regunberg, the climate accountability project director at the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which signed the letter.\n\nThe authors of the letter do not have hard evidence of a current industry push for legal immunity, but their concerns come amid wider attacks on climate litigation.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump pledged to “stop the wave of frivolous litigation from environmental extremists”. And this month, a rightwing thinktank launched a campaign attempting to shoot down litigation from “radical climate groups”, which it called the “biggest risk” to Donald Trump’s energy agenda, E&E News reported. The thinktank has ties to Leonard Leo, who is widely known as a force behind the Federalist Society, which orchestrated the ultraconservative takeover of the American judiciary.\n\nLast year, Leo-tied groups also launched another campaign, which one expert called “unprecedented”, to convince the supreme court to shield oil companies from lawsuits. In decisions this week and in January, the high court denied their request.\n\nA truck parked outside a major fossil fuel conference on Monday in Houston, warned that “lawfare and anti-energy laws are threatening America’s pro-consumer energy dominance”, linking to an op-ed from a group with links to Leo.\nAnother development sparking worry at oil companies: “climate superfund” bills, meant to make big polluters help pay for climate action.\n\nLast year, Vermont and New York passed such measures, which are loosely modeled on the US superfund program. Ten other states are considering similar proposals, which could each cost the industry billions or trillions.\n\nRed states and oil lobby groups are legally challenging the laws. This week, the Federalist Society – which Leo co-chairs – hosted a panel criticizing the measures.\n\n“If they are seeking a liability waiver, they might also seek congressional action precluding the state climate superfund laws,” Gerrard said.\n\nIt is a major fear for Cassidy DiPaola of the pro-climate superfund group Make Polluters Pay, which signed the letter.\n\n“What’s at stake here isn’t just who pays for climate disasters,” she said. “It’s whether our democracy allows powerful industries to simply rewrite the rules when justice catches up to them.”", "sentences": ["Nearly 200 environmental and legal advocacy groups have urged Congress to reject any attempt by the fossil fuel industry to obtain legal immunity from climate lawsuits.", "These groups fear that with Republican control of government, the industry may push for a liability waiver similar to one granted to the firearms sector, shielding them from accountability for decades of pollution and deception.", "Although there is no direct evidence of an active immunity campaign, advocates cite historical efforts and current political moves, including anti-litigation rhetoric from Donald Trump and thinktank campaigns linked to conservative influencer Leonard Leo.", "These developments come amid increasing climate accountability lawsuits and the emergence of 'climate superfund' laws in states like New York and Vermont, which seek to make polluters pay for climate damages.", "Critics warn that granting immunity would undermine justice and allow industries to bypass consequences through political influence.", "The letter emphasizes the broader democratic risk of letting powerful interests escape responsibility."]}

There is the US government, which will limit its participation [but] the US is a country with such amazing technology, amazing innovation – this is the US that can contribute. The US is a central country for these discussions and solutions.”\n\nBrazil has also vowed to hold an “ethical stocktake” aimed at examining climate justice issues, for poor and vulnerable people, and to give Indigenous people a key role at the talks.\n\nCorrêa do Lago wrote to all UN countries on Monday, setting out Brazil’s expectations that all governments will draw up national plans for steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions before the conference starts in Belém, a rainforest city at the mouth of the Amazon, in November.\n\n“Cop30 will be the first [summit] to take place at the epicentre of the climate crisis, and the first to be hosted in the Amazon, one of the world’s most vital ecosystems, now at risk of reaching an irreversible tipping point, according to scientists,” the letter said. “Change is inevitable, either by choice or catastrophe.”\n\nAs well as the formal negotiations at the summit in which only national governments can take part, there will be forums for regional and local governments – including those from the US – and for businesses and investors. Corrêa do Lago said these would be essential for progress because the Cop should involve an ongoing process of implementing climate action, rather than simply a focus on two weeks of technical negotiations.\n\n“There is a perception these Cops are just about negotiation,” he said. “But we believe that accelerating implementation [of previously agreed actions] is very important. Let’s see how we can accelerate what we have already agreed.”\n\nBrazil faces one of the worst geopolitical situations of any “conference of the parties” (Cop) since the UN framework convention on climate change, parent treaty to the 2015 Paris agreement, was signed in 1992. Trump has not only begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris accord, but is also rescinding climate finance pledged to the developing world, and dismantling federal support for climate science.\n\nTrump’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting rearmament of Europe which is under way, have left the developed world in turmoil. Many developing countries are concerned that they will be left further behind, amid the wrangling of the biggest economies.\n\nAna Toni, the chief executive of Cop30, pointed to the outcome of the recently reconvened conference of the parties to the UN convention on biological diversity, which produced agreement on a plan to finance nature protection. “It was a really challenging moment, but we did see agreement,” she pointed out.\n\nMany investors and businesses were expressing an interest in Cop30, she added. “We need to ensure [country’s emission-cutting] plans are investable and implementable,” she said. “We have had some very, very positive engagement with investors so far. They know the transition [to a low-carbon economy] is inevitable, and are looking for places where investments can be made.”\n\nAs well as setting out why stiff emissions cuts are needed, and urging governments to take drastic action to avoid climate catastrophe, Brazil’s letter to all governments pointedly referred to the spirit that defeated the Nazis in the second world war. Quoting Hannah Arendt, the philosopher who studied Hitler and his associates, it said: “Arendt denounced the ‘banality of evil’ as the acceptance of what was unacceptable. Now, we face the ‘banality of inaction’, an irresponsible and unacceptable inaction.”\n\nThe letter also invoked the Brazilian concepts of “mutirão”, which comes from the Tupi-Guarani language, and refers to a community coming together to work on shared task, and “virada”, which means fighting back in a game when defeat seems almost certain.\n\nIlan Zugman, the Latin America and Caribbean director at 350.org, said: “The proactive and detailed nature of this letter from the Cop30 presidency is an encouraging sign – especially in contrast to Cop29. This early engagement signals an intent to shape the agenda rather than react to it.\n\n“It emphasises unity in the face of climate change rather than cynicism, aligning with Indigenous perspectives on collective action.

Further, a bigger and more immediate problem was energy poverty, Wright said.\n\n“Where is the Cop conference for this far more urgent global challenge,” he said, referring to the annual United Nations climate talks, known as the Conference of the Parties (Cop). “I look forward to working with all of you to better energize the world and fully unleash human potential.”\n\nThe night before his CERAWeek plenary session, Wright had a meeting with top executives of fossil fuel firms including TotalEnergies, Freeport-McMoRan, Occidental Petroleum, and EQT, Axios and Reuters reported. Trump’s interior secretary, Doug Burgum, who will address CERAWeek attenders on Wednesday, also attended the dinner meeting.\n\nTrump obtained record donations from the fossil fuel industry in his 2024 campaign. In April, he came under fire for a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, at which he reportedly asked more than 20 executives, from companies including Chevron, Exxon and Occidental, for $1bn and promised, if elected, to slash climate policies.\n\nUnder Biden, Wright said, ordinary Americans suffered. “The expensive energy or climate policies that have been in vogue among the left in wealthy western nations have taken a heavy toll on their citizens,” he said, putting the word “climate” in scare quotes.\n\nUS citizens “heat our homes in winter, cool them in summer, store period foods in our freezers and refrigerators and have light, communications and entertainment at the flip of a switch,” he said – a lifestyle that “requires an average of 13 barrels of oil per person per year”.\n\nMeanwhile poorer countries lack energy, he said, meaning they need more fossil fuels.\n\n“The other 7 billion people on average, consume only three barrels of oil per person per year,” he said. “Africans average less than one barrel.”\n\nThe comments came after Wright addressed the Powering Africa Summit in Washington DC on Friday, saying that it would be “paternalistic” and “100% nonsense” to encourage Africa to halt coal development because of climate concerns.\n“Coal transformed our world and made it better, extended life expectancy and grew opportunities,” he said.\nThe comments came under fire from climate advocates globally.\n\n“One of the transformations caused by American fossil fuels was destroying our previously well-balanced climate and plunging some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in Africa into a life dealing with extreme weather and lost homes and livelihoods,” said Mohamed Adow, founding director of Power Shift Africa, a non-governmental organization and thinktank based in Nairobi.\n\nThe African continent also had huge potential to expand renewable energy, “but lacks the right investments to exploit these resources”, said Ali Mohamed, the chair of the African group of negotiators and Kenya’s special envoy for climate change.\n\nAt CERAWeek, Wright said the Trump administration was embracing an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy.\n\n“Anything that adds affordable, reliable energy, we are in favor of,” he told reporters in a press conference after his speech, where he also announced the extension of a permit for the company Delfin, which is developing a floating liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Louisiana.\n\nBut domestic oil and gas production soared to record levels under Biden. And Trump has launched a war on renewable energy, temporarily suspending all clean energy development on federal lands and attacking wind and solar in speeches.\n\nWright’s speech was not made available to the public via live stream, sparking outrage from climate advocates.\n\n“As energy secretary, Chris Wright is supposed to serve the American people, not the fossil fuel industry,” said Allie Rosenbluth, a campaign manager at the non-profit Oil Change International. “It’s unacceptable, though not surprising, that this former fracking CEO is depriving the public of the chance to see what he’s saying to fossil fuel executives.”\n\nWright has long been a fixture at the CERAWeek fossil fuels conference. Before joining the Trump administration, he led the oil and gas company Liberty Energy for 13 years.\nAhead of his press conference, one representative from an oil industry podcast said the energy secretary was “brilliant”.\n\n“He’s one of us,” the person said. “He gets us.”", "sentences": ["Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, told oil executives at CERAWeek that the U.", "S.", "will pursue increased fossil fuel production, criticizing Biden’s climate policies as damaging and ideologically driven.", "Wright, a former fracking executive, acknowledged climate change but downplayed the ability of renewables to replace fossil fuels and emphasized the need to address global energy poverty.", "He argued that developing nations, especially in Africa, should not be discouraged from using coal, sparking backlash from climate advocates.", "Wright promoted an 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy and announced a permit extension for a floating LNG project.", "Critics condemned the lack of public access to his speech and accused the Trump administration of prioritizing fossil fuel interests over climate and public welfare.", "His remarks reflect a broader rollback of climate initiatives and a renewed alignment with the fossil fuel industry."]}

The White House has also begun a purge of climate references from government websites.\n\nCampaigners told the Guardian these actions would have a major impact on the ability of poor countries to cope with extreme weather. Anne Jellema, the executive director of 350.org, told the Guardian: “The US retreat from its global climate finance commitments is a staggering blow to the chances of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. By abruptly axing nearly a tenth of the limited funds for climate protection in developing countries, it is effectively abandoning millions of communities who have done nothing to cause global heating but who are losing homes, livelihoods and lives because of it.”\n\nShe called on other countries to step up. “Now is the moment for wealthy nations to rise above politics and show real leadership. The world is watching, and the stakes have never been higher. We must act together to keep hope alive for a livable future.”\nTrump’s newly formed “department of government efficiency”, headed by Elon Musk, has been firing USAid staff and ending shipments. Though some have been reinstated after controversy and court orders, Trump is likely to continue his efforts to cut all forms of aid, with climate a key target.\n\nUnder Trump’s last presidency, climate finance also fell sharply. This time, it is likely to fall further under the onslaught on all forms of government spending.\n\nThe US has long contributed far less to climate finance, proportionate to its status as the world’s biggest economy and biggest carbon emitter, than other developed countries. Though Joe Biden markedly increased the funds during his term, he faced a struggle with the Republican-dominated Congress to do so.\n\nClimate finance is needed to help poor countries cope with the already evident impacts of the climate crisis, such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and storms. The developing world is sustaining hundreds of billions of dollars in damage as a result, with the effects expected to intensify further.\n\nThese countries are already spending large chunks of their existing domestic budgets patching up the damage and trying to improve their resilience, depriving them of funds needed for health, education and economic development.\n\nRich governments carry an obligation under the Paris agreement to provide funds to poor nations, which have done little to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but bear the brunt of the damage.\n\nLast November, at the annual conference of the parties (Cop) of the UNFCCC, all countries agreed that climate finance should reach $1.3tn a year by 2035. The bulk of this will come from the private sector, some is likely to come from charges on high-carbon activities such as shipping and aviation, and at least $300bn is to come from the developed world.\n\nWithout sizeable contributions from the US, the world’s biggest economy, those numbers are likely to be much harder to reach.\n\nHarjeet Singh, founding director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said: “As the largest historical emitter, the US bears a significant share of the blame for the climate adversities affecting vulnerable populations worldwide. We must hold them accountable and ensure they contribute their fair share towards global climate reparations.”\n\nCountries with rapidly growing economies that are still classed as developing under the UN, such as China, the United Arab Emirates, and other oil states, also contribute to climate finance.

The fund signalled a commitment by developed, polluting countries to provide financial support for some of the irreversible economic and noneconomic losses from sea level rise, desertification, drought and floods already happening.\n\nThe US has a long record of delay tactics and obstructionism, and had so far pledged only $17.5m (£13.5m) to the loss and damage fund, which became operational on 1 January this year. Now the US, the biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, will no longer participate in the initiative.\n\n“On behalf of the United States Department of the Treasury, I write to inform you that the United States is withdrawing from the board for the fund for responding to loss and damage, effective immediately,” said Rebecca Lawlor, the deputy director at the US Office of Climate and Environment, in a letter to the fund.\nThe decision to abandon the loss and damage fund was condemned by climate advocates from the global north and south.\n\n“The US decision to step away from this commitment at such a crucial moment sends the wrong message to the global community and to those in dire need of assistance,” said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy analyst and director of the thinktank Power Shift Africa. “We urge the United States to reconsider its position in the interest of the planet and future generations … this regrettable decision risks undermining collective progress and erodes the trust necessary for effective international cooperation.”\n\nRachel Rose Jackson, a research director at Corporate Accountability, said: “Let’s be clear – the US has never been a climate champion. Yet the Trump administration’s anti-climate action agenda – including its withdrawal from the loss and damage fund board – is a wrecking ball made of dynamite. It’s dangerous, it’s malicious and it will destroy lives.\n\n“We cannot allow the Trump administration, and the greedy corporations pulling the strings, to get away with destroying the planet. It’s time for the United States to pay up its climate debt and do its fair share of climate action.”\n\nAli Mohamed, the chair of the African Group of Negotiators, a coalition of African nations participating in UN climate negotiations, said: “This decision, made by the nation with the largest historical responsibility for climate change, jeopardises vital support for vulnerable countries facing irreversible climate impacts.”\n\nTrump has already pulled out of the 2015 Paris climate accords – for the second time after the US was reinstated under Joe Biden – claiming the international agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions and preventing climate catastrophe ripped off the US.\n\n“I’m immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris climate accord rip-off,” he said, signing the executive order on his first day in office. “The United States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity.”\n\nChina currently ranks as the top greenhouse gas emitter but is also the global leader in the manufacture and deployment of renewable energy. The US is the largest historical emitter and, while emissions have fallen alongside reductions in coal, it has become the world’s largest oil and gas producer by a huge margin in recent years.\n\nRecord-breaking ocean and atmospheric temperatures have caused chaos around the world and across the US, including devastating wildfires in Los Angeles and deadly flooding across Florida and southern Appalachia. Meanwhile, several of Trump’s policies, including his pledge to “drill, baby drill”, dismantle federal agencies, and impose tariffs that threaten a trade war, risk derailing the burgeoning US renewables sector.\n\nThe loss and damage fund is a work in progress. As of late January, 27 countries had pledged a combined total of $741m – the equivalent of about 0.2% of the irreversible losses developing countries are facing from global heating every year.\n\nThe US withdrawal appears to be another rejection of global diplomacy and the reality of the climate crisis.\n\nHarjeet Singh, a climate activist and founding director of the Delhi-based Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said: “The decision by the Trump administration exemplifies a longstanding pattern of obstruction by the US government in securing necessary finance for addressing climate impacts, [and] undermines global efforts to deliver climate justice.\n\n“As the largest historical emitter, the United States bears a significant share of the blame for the climate adversities affecting vulnerable populations worldwide.

It has also influenced climate litigation around the world.\n\nHowever, there was resistance within Switzerland from the start, and by the summer the Swiss federal council had rebuffed the ruling.\n\nWhile it acknowledged the importance of the underlying European convention on human rights, the Swiss government said the court’s interpretation was too broad in extending it to the climate crisis and in accepting a complaint from an organisation.\n\nIt claimed it was already doing enough to cut national emissions, and submitted an “action report” in October rather than the required action plan. This maintained that the judgment did not require it to set specific carbon budgets and that there was no internationally recognised method for doing so.\n\nThe committee of ministers, which is responsible for upholding the judgment, noted this week that Switzerland had closed some legislative gaps, including revising its CO2 act and setting goals up to 2030.\n\nBut it invited Switzerland to provide more information showing how its climate framework aligned with the court’s ruling, “through a carbon budget or otherwise, of national greenhouse gas emissions limitations”. The committee took note of methodologies put forward by a broad coalition of NGOs to calculate this.\n\nGeorg Klingler, a project coordinator and climate campaigner at Greenpeace, which supported the Swiss women’s case, said this essentially meant setting budgets that reflected Switzerland’s “fair share” of emission reductions in line with the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting warming to under 1.5C. That could mean toughening up existing goals, he said.\n\nThe Swiss government was also told to keep the committee of ministers informed about planned adaptation measures to protect vulnerable citizens during events such as heatwaves. And it must provide “concrete examples” of citizens’ involvement in developing climate policies. Switzerland has until September to provide this information.\n\nThe KlimaSeniorinnen co-president Rosmarie Wydler-Wälti welcomed the decision. She called on the Swiss federal council and parliament “to take the dangers of global warming seriously and finally take decisive action against the climate crisis”.\n\nSébastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, said European governments had “reaffirmed the rule of law”. “The decision … makes clear that the Swiss federal council must fulfil its legal obligation to protect its citizens’ human rights by ramping up its climate ambition.”\n\nBaşak Çalı, a professor of international law at the Oxford Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, said: “It is a good day for respect for European court judgments and international law. This decision also shows just how important international institutions – such as the European court – are for helping to improve the lives of people everywhere.”\n\nIn a statement, the Swiss federal government said the “competent authorities” would analyse the decision and determine what further information they would submit, adding: “The aim is to demonstrate that Switzerland is complying with the climate policy requirements of the ruling.”", "sentences": ["The Council of Europe has told Switzerland it must strengthen its climate policies to comply with a landmark European Court of Human Rights ruling, which found the government had failed to protect older women from climate-related harms.", "The ruling followed a successful case by KlimaSeniorinnen, a group of elderly women arguing that heatwaves endangered their rights.", "Although Switzerland submitted an 'action report,' it fell short of the required action plan and did not include a carbon budget.", "The committee of ministers called on Switzerland to align its emissions targets with the court’s decision and provide clearer evidence of citizen involvement and protective adaptation measures.", "Climate advocates welcomed the ruling’s enforcement as a step toward accountability and stronger climate action across Europe.", "Switzerland has until September to demonstrate its compliance and clarify how its climate strategy meets legal human rights obligations."]}

Its satellite observations stretch back to the late 1970s and its historical observations to the middle of the 20th century.\n\nScientists had already observed an extreme heat anomaly in the north pole at the start of February, which caused temperatures to soar more than 20C above average and cross the threshold for ice to melt. They described the latest broken record as “particularly worrying” because ice reflects sunlight and cools the planet.\n\n“The lack of sea ice means darker ocean surfaces and the ability of the Earth to absorb more sunlight, which accelerates the warming,” said Mika Rantanen, a climate scientist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.\n\nThe strong winter warming event in the Arctic in early February had prevented sea ice from growing normally, he added. “I believe that this meteorological event, combined with the long-term decline of sea ice due to anthropogenic climate change, was the primary cause of the lowest Arctic sea ice extent on record.”\n\nGlobal sea ice extent varies throughout the year but typically reaches its annual minimum in February, when it is summer in the southern hemisphere.\n\nC3S said February 2025 was the third hottest February it had seen. Global temperatures were 1.59C hotter than preindustrial levels, making it the 19th month in the past 20 that was more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels.\n\nEarth observation programmes such as C3S rely on the reanalysis of billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to create snapshots of the state of the climate. The agency cautioned that the margins above 1.5C were small in several months, and could differ slightly in other datasets.\n\nThe broken sea ice record comes after last year was confirmed as the hottest year on record and a Guardian analysis of C3S data revealed that two-thirds of the world’s surface was seared by record-breaking monthly heat in 2024. The El Niño weather pattern in the first half of the year added to the background heating effect of fossil fuel pollution, which traps sunlight.\nEl Niño has since subsided and morphed into a weak form of its cooler counterpart, La Niña. The World Meteorological Organization said on Thursday they expected the La Niña that emerged in December to be short-lived.\n\nRichard Allan, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, said the long-term prognosis for Arctic sea ice was grim.\n\n“The region continues to rapidly heat up, and can only be saved with rapid and massive cuts to greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. “That will also limit the growing severity of weather extremes and long-term sea level rise across the world.”\n\nThe headline of this article was amended on 6 March 2025 to clarify that global sea ice cover in February fell to its lowest level on record.

Cutting methane, a gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, would give the world breathing space in the fight to control temperature rises, many scientists have said.\n\nThe Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been assessing the use of 3-NOP and says the additive has undergone rigorous testing over 10 years. According to Bovaer’s manufacturer, DSM-Firmenich, the additive is now approved in 68 countries and given to more than 200,000 cows.\n\nBut what should have been an exciting announcement of a pioneering scheme to help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions quickly became a social media storm about the health effects of the additive, with people videoing themselves throwing away products by the brand and pouring milk down their sinks in protest.\n\nOn 2 December, the Reform MP Rupert Lowe stated on X that he “won’t be consuming anything containing Bovaer”, and had requested that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs undertook “an urgent review of its use in our food system”.\n\nSome posters had been linking to a report by the FSA published in 2023 that found 3-NOP “should be considered corrosive to the eyes, a skin irritant, and potentially harmful by inhalation” to humans handling it.\n\nThe agency eventually had to release further guidance on the safety of using Bovaer, stating that the additive breaks down in the digestive tract and is therefore not present in milk produced by the cows ingesting it, so would not pose any risk for human consumption. The guidance above would only apply to handling 3-NOP in its pure form at the manufacturing stage.\n\nOther concerned social media users pointed to claims that 3-NOP could cause cancer. However, the results of a UK government assessment had concluded: “The additive is not carcinogenic at the recommended inclusion rate.”\n\nSomehow Bill Gates got dragged in too, with one variant of the conspiracy arguing that he was using his wealth to invest in population control – referring again to the concerns that if handled in its pure form, 3-NOP could cause male infertility.\n\nWhile the Microsoft co-founder has no connection to Bovaer, or its manufacturer, he has invested in a rival startup called Rumin8, which develops a similar methane-reducing product using seaweed to break down the gas.\n\nArla released a statement dismissing any involvement from Gates in the trials, and DSM-Firmenich, a Swiss-Dutch company that develops products for the health, beauty, and nutrition industries, said it had “fully developed” Bovaer and that the company had “no other investors”.\n\nThe FSA website said: “The FSA safety assessment concluded there are no safety concerns when Bovaer is used at the approved dose.\n\n“More than 58 studies on potential risks were evaluated and it was concluded that the additive is safe at twice the recommended dose. The additive is metabolised by the cows so does not pass into the milk. It was not found in milk in any of the trials presented to the FSA.”\n\nAnswering questions at a press briefing on Monday about the scale of the misinformation, Dr Sinéad Waters, a senior researcher in host microbiome interactions at the University of Galway, said, “It’s a good wake-up call to scientists because really communication is with the farmers.\n\n“We want to bring everyone along with us on the journey. Communication is key, we need to do more of that, not just with the farmers but with the general public.”\n\nAlso speaking at the briefing at the Science Media Centre was Prof Robin May, the chief scientific adviser at the FSA. He said: “The overwhelming response we saw from the public was confusion rather than jumping on board. The more communication and transparency the better.”", "sentences": ["The cattle feed additive Bovaer, proven to reduce methane emissions, became the subject of widespread misinformation following a pilot program by food giant Arla.", "Claims on social media alleged health risks, including cancer and infertility, and falsely linked Bill Gates to population control, despite no connection between him and the product.", "The UK’s Food Standards Agency clarified that Bovaer is safe for use, does not enter the milk supply, and poses no risk to consumers.", "Scientists emphasized that misinformation about the product shows the urgent need for better public communication about climate solutions.", "The incident has drawn attention from political figures and prompted renewed calls for transparent science outreach.", "Experts stress that reducing methane is critical in addressing climate change and Bovaer remains a scientifically backed method to achieve that goal."]}

Critics accuse the ICAO of having been captured by the industry, resulting in slow efforts to tackle the climate crisis by reducing the carbon emissions from aircraft.\n\nThe next meeting of CAEP begins on Monday but there is no public information on its agenda or the people who will be running the conference. The ICAO has been criticised for a lack of transparency that contrasts sharply with, for example, the UN’s climate body.\n\nThe ICAO does not routinely make its meeting documents freely available, instead charging hundreds of dollars for password-protected copies. Neither the media nor the public can attend CAEP conferences, and observer delegates are required to sign non-disclosure agreements that incur “unlimited financial liability”.\n\nFlying causes more climate-heating pollution than any other form of transport for every kilometre and is dominated by rich passengers, with 1% of the world’s population responsible for 50% of aviation emissions. The industry’s climate plans are rated “critically insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker.\n\nThe ICAO forecasts a doubling of passenger numbers by 2042, and the industry argues that more efficient aircraft, sustainable fuels and the ICAO’s offsetting scheme can control carbon emissions.\n\nIndependent experts say the feasible scale of such measures is extremely unlikely to compensate for such a huge growth in traffic. For example, the “unambitious and problematic” offsetting scheme has yet to require any airline to use a carbon credit and fuel-efficiency improvements are stalling. The experts say aviation growth must be curbed if climate targets are to be met.\n\nLucca Ewbank, the transport lead at InfluenceMap, the thinktank that analysed the delegate data, said: “The level of access and potential influence given to the fossil fuel and aviation industries by ICAO is extremely concerning and risks the capture of global climate negotiations by vested interests.\n\n“The [lack of] transparency also works in industry’s favour, allowing them to privately influence climate negotiations and push their vested interests without external scrutiny. Industry appears to have exerted significant influence over environmental negotiations at ICAO, resulting in rules that serve the interest of aviation companies at the expense of science-aligned climate action.”\n\nSpecific technical information on aircraft discussed at CAEP might be commercially sensitive, one delegate told the Guardian, but secrecy should not be “a general rule that governs everything”.\n\nThe ICAO did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe big CAEP meetings take place every three years and 439 delegates attended the previous event in 2022. Analysis by InfluenceMap showed that 125 (29%) were from the aviation industry, including at least 16 representatives who attended the meeting as part of their national delegations. The latter included delegates from Saudi Aramco, the United Arab Emirate’s national oil company, Adnoc, and its two national airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates, and from Japan Airlines.\n\nThe International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Associations, which represents manufacturers, provided the most industry delegates, with 62, followed by the Airports Council International (28) and the International Business Aviation Council (10).\n\nThere were only 11 delegates from environmental groups. In contrast, at the UN’s Cop29 climate summit, only 1.5% of attenders were from the fossil fuel industry or lobbyists.\nAlso unlike UN climate summits, recent ICAO events have been sponsored by industry companies. An ICAO “stocktaking event” on aviation emissions reductions in October 2024 was sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell Aviation, Airbus and the leading trade body for airlines, the International Air Transport Association (IATA).\n\nAnother ICAO event, on aviation and alternative fuels in Dubai in November 2023, was sponsored by Adnoc, Etihad, Air Arabia and Boeing as well as Shell Aviation, Airbus and IATA.\n\nInfluenceMap’s analysis also linked industry figures to influential positions. Kevin Walsh, now vice-president at the trade body Airlines for America, was listed in the report of the 2022 CAEP meeting as being vice-chair for the next CAEP meeting. In 2022, he was part of the US delegation and worked for the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nCAEP has 11 working groups, whose membership is not made public. However, analysis of LinkedIn profiles indicated industry representatives on these groups. Three people from Saudi Aramco were on the fuel task group, as was one from Adnoc, and United Airlines was also represented on working groups. Staff from industry trade bodies were also on working groups, including some from the Airports Council International and IATA.\n\nThere have been calls for increased transparency, with an unnamed member CAEP highlighting the need for this, according to the report of the 2022 meeting. Another delegate, also unnamed, said “transparency is the lifeblood of effective governance”, focusing on “improving access, broadening participation, and ensuring accountability”.\n\nThe US delegation called publicly for greater transparency in 2022, saying this would “improve [CAEP’s] accountability to the public it seeks to serve” and that other UN bodies released all papers for decision meetings publicly and in advance of meetings.

It’s not upholding a rule of law.\n\n“What those people have been jailed for is trying to get information to the public that the fossil fuel companies have been systematically concealing from the public for decades and decades. And good information is the lifeblood of democracy and that’s why those people have been jailed, for trying to get that to the public.”\n\nProtesters held placards showing photographs of jailed activists, including those whose cases were being heard in court on Thursday, as well as photographs of famous political prisoners such as Angela Davis and Nelson Mandela who had, said Crosland, “fought for the freedoms that we enjoy”.\n\nThe broadcasters Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Chris Packham were among those who joined the protest. “We feel our basic democratic rights to protest peacefully are being eroded,” Fearnley-Whittingstall said.\n“We are here in solidarity with the 16 defendants who were given draconian sentences last year for entirely peaceful protest, that they did because their consciences demanded it from them, not for personal gain. Now we seem to have a judicial situation where acting on your conscience is almost seen to be an aggravating factor in your sentence – it used to be a mitigating factor.”\n\nSoon after protesters occupied the Strand they were surrounded by yellow-jacketed police officers, who warned them that if they did not move, a section 14 order would be imposed and they would be arrested.

Secondly, the low rainfall seen from October to December is now about 2.4 times more likely than in the preindustrial past, before the climate crisis. Rains during these months have historically brought an end to the wildfire season around LA.\n\nThirdly, conditions of high fire risk have extended by more than three weeks in today’s heated climate, now reaching into January. This means fires have more chance of breaking out during the peak Santa Ana winds, which can blow small fires into deadly infernos.\n\nThe extreme fires began blazing around LA on 7 January. Powerful mountain winds drove the fires through tinder-dry vegetation and into urban areas. At least 28 people were killed and more than 10,000 homes destroyed. The fires are the most destructive in LA’s history and may be the costliest in US history.\n\nThe study was carried out by 32 US and European experts working as part of the World Weather Attribution (WWA) collaboration. The demonstration of a clear link to the climate crisis runs counter to the flood of disinformation that followed the fires, which included falsely blaming fish protections, a mass plot related to high-speed rail, and diversity measures.\n\n“Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,” said Dr Clair Barnes, at Imperial College London, UK, who led the study. “Without a faster transition away from planet-heating fossil fuels, California will continue to get hotter, drier and more flammable.”\n\nThe study used weather data and climate models to compare the likelihood of fire conditions in today’s hotter climate with the likelihood in an unheated preindustrial climate. Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies have used these methods before. The weather data and models clearly showed an increased risk of hot, dry and windy conditions due to human-caused global heating.\n\nThe weather data also showed the low rainfall and extended dry period were significantly more likely today. In these cases, the climate models showed considerable uncertainties, because only a small area was being studied and winds are highly variable in mountainous regions.\n\nNonetheless, the scientists said: “Given all the lines of evidence we have high confidence that human-induced climate change increased the likelihood of the devastating LA fires.” A preliminary study looking only at the hot, dry and windy conditions also found that climate change was a factor in the LA fires. Globally, scientists agree that climate change is increasing the global risk of wildfires starting and spreading as persistent heat dries out soils and vegetation.\n\nRoop Singh, at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: “A deadly combination of factors came together to turn this wildfire into a disaster – climate change set the stage. These fires have highlighted just how vulnerable California is to winter wildfires, underscoring the need for better preparation for a more dangerous future.”\n\nThe study highlighted issues with the water infrastructure that was unable to keep up with the extreme needs during the Eaton and Palisades wildfires. Officials have said power outages meant pumps were unable to operate. The WWA team also emphasised the importance of early warning and evacuation systems as 17 of the 28 deaths occurred in west Altadena, a neighbourhood with high African American home ownership, and where warnings were delayed compared with other affected areas.\n\nDr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London and a co-lead of WWA, said: “From violent hurricanes in the east, to nightmarish wildfires in the west, Americans are experiencing the devastating consequences of fossil fuel warming. In 2025, the choices facing world leaders remain the same – to continue to burn oil, gas and coal and experience ever more dangerous weather, or transition to renewable energy for a safer and fairer world.”\n\nNew US president Donald Trump has pledged to “drill, baby, drill” and pulled the US from the Paris climate agreement, joining only a handful of war-torn states– Libya, Iran and Yemen. However, many other countries remain committed to climate action.\n\nThe LA fires were an example of climate “whiplash” between extremely wet and dry conditions which exacerbates disasters and which are increasing exponentially around the world because of global heating. In LA, wet conditions in the previous two years enabled strong growth of vegetation, providing fuel for the fires when dry conditions returned.\n\nToxic smoke from the LA fires has also affected millions of people and will claim further lives. A global study published in November found that from 2000 to 2019 about 1.5m deaths a year were associated with the dirty air caused by wildfires. Heart attacks, strokes and respiratory deaths are the most common, but worsened diabetes, kidney disease and mental health also contribute.\n\nIn North America, there have been more than 25,000 deaths a year on average from wildfire pollution, with the number rising by 3% a year over that time. “[The pollution] often travels hundreds and even thousands of kilometres away and affects much larger populations than flames and heat do,” said Prof Yuming Guo at Monash University, Australia, who led the study.\n\nAn editorial in the Lancet medical journal last week said: “The evidence is clear on the increasing risk of wildfires due to climate change, and the impact on physical and mental health. Will the California wildfires make [politicians] face reality? Turning away is bringing harms and destruction that are increasingly impossible to ignore.”", "sentences": ["A new study by World Weather Attribution (WWA) finds that climate change significantly increased the likelihood of the recent record-breaking wildfires in Los Angeles.", "The fires, which killed 28 people and destroyed over 10,000 homes, were fueled by a combination of unusually hot, dry, and windy conditions, a prolonged fire season, and historically low rainfall—all linked to global warming.", "Scientists concluded that such extreme fire conditions are now much more common due to fossil fuel-driven climate change.", "The study also highlighted failures in infrastructure and emergency response, particularly in vulnerable communities.", "Toxic smoke from the fires is expected to cause widespread health impacts, adding to the already rising death toll from wildfire pollution in North America.", "Experts warn that without urgent cuts to emissions, such disasters will become increasingly frequent and deadly."]}

Residents are being asked if collections should stay the same or move to a three-week or four-week pattern.\nBristol is home to about 483,000 people living in more than 191,000 households, and growing. The council says that on average, each person creates up to 400kg of household waste a year.\n\nFor the past two years, Bristol has recycled about 45% of its household waste – among the best records in the UK – but the council says the recycling rate is dropping, making change vital.\n\nCouncillor Martin Fodor, the chair of the environment and sustainability committee, said: “Anything that ends up in the black bin waste is taken away for incineration or sent to landfill – both of which come with serious environmental and cost issues.\n\n“Burning or leaving waste to decompose in landfill releases carbon and other harmful substances into the atmosphere. This pollutes the air around us and also contributes to fuelling climate change.\n\n“Changing government regulation and the increasing costs of dealing with black bin waste means that to keep managing our city’s waste as we currently do is set to become much more expensive.”\n\nThe council estimates that the introduction of new charges on disposing black bin waste by incinerating it or sending it to landfill will add over £8m a year on top of existing charges to the cost of managing the city’s waste system, if changes are not made.\n\nIt says a quarter of black bin waste in Bristol is food waste that could be recycled in the food waste bin and a quarter is paper and card, glass, plastic and cans, textiles and small electrical items that also could all be recycled.\n\nFodor said: “We firmly believe that by collecting black bin waste once every three or four weeks instead of two will increase the amount of waste our city recycles, reduce costs and significantly lower carbon emissions.”\n\nThe council acknowledges that if it does move to monthly collections, it will have to make changes to how people can recycle, possibly increasing the use of recycling sacks or introducing recycling bins for each household.\n\nIt will look at offering larger bins for larger households and an extra collection for people with sanitary products or nappies.\n\nTom Renhard, the Bristol city council’s Labour group leader, said: “Before you start considering whether to go to three- or four-weekly bin collections, there needs to be a focus on sorting out the existing service first and make sure that’s functioning as it should be.”\n\nHe called for innovations such as a city-wide nappy recycling scheme and better measures to tackle soft plastic waste.\n\nResidents who have signed the Labour petition include Amy, who did not give her surname, who said: “It will increase rubbish on the streets and put families under pressure. Even if families recycle as much of their waste as possible, there are still a considerable amount of things that need to go in the black bin.”", "sentences": ["Bristol city council is considering reducing black bin rubbish collections to once every four weeks, which would make it the first in England to do so.", "The Green-led council argues the move could save over £2m annually and boost recycling rates, which have recently declined.", "Critics, including nearly 2,000 petitioners, worry this change could lead to more fly-tipping and household pressure.", "The council, however, claims there’s no evidence of increased fly-tipping in areas with less frequent collections.", "A six-week consultation is underway, with potential adjustments to recycling infrastructure and support for larger households.", "The decision will also factor in rising costs tied to incineration and landfill, which may exceed £8m without changes."]}

It’s very sort of Game of Thrones-esque, actually,” he said, describing “feeling like it would never end”.\n\nA23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called “iceberg alley”.\n\nWeighing a bit under a trillion tonnes, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world’s most powerful ocean “jet stream” – the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\n\nMeijers said that was tracking “more or less a straight line from where it is now to South Georgia” where waters quickly turn shallow and the current bends sharply.\n\nThe iceberg could follow that current out to sea or run aground the shelf, he said.\n\nIt is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are undertaking foraging expeditions in the frosty waters to bring back enough food to fatten their young.\n\n“If the iceberg parks there, it’ll either block physically where they feed from, or they’ll have to go around it,” said Meijers.\n\n“That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that’s less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.”\nThe seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a “bad season” with an outbreak of bird flu “and that [iceberg] would make it significantly worse”, he said.\n\n“It would be fairly tragic, but it’s not unprecedented.”\n\nAs A23a ultimately melts it could litter the ocean with small – but still hazardous – chunks of ice difficult for fishermen to navigate, Meijers added.\n\nIt would also seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nWhile icebergs were very natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to the human-induced climate crisis.", "sentences": ["The world's largest iceberg, A23a, is drifting toward South Georgia Island, raising concerns about its impact on local wildlife.", "Scientists warn it could run aground, potentially blocking access to feeding grounds for penguins and seals already facing a tough season due to bird flu.", "The iceberg, which calved from Antarctica in 1986, only began moving in 2020 and is now being carried by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.", "Experts are unsure whether it will drift out to sea or get stuck on South Georgia’s shallow shelf.", "If grounded, it could lead to increased mortality among seal pups and penguin chicks by making feeding more difficult.", "While posing risks, the melting iceberg may also stimulate ocean ecosystems by releasing nutrients, though its movement highlights growing concerns about climate change."]}
{"doc_id": "article_048", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Revolutionary scanner to be fired into Earth orbit this month to measure effects of deforestation.\nScientists are about to take part in a revolutionary mission aimed at creating detailed 3D maps of the world’s remotest, densest and darkest tropical forests – from outer space. The feat will be achieved using a special radar scanner that has been fitted to a probe, named Biomass, that will be fired into the Earth’s orbit later this month.\n\nFor the next five years, the 1.25-tonne spacecraft will sweep over the tropical rainforests of Africa, Asia and South America and peer through their dense 40m-high ­canopies to study the vegetation that lies beneath. The data collected by Biomass will then be used to create unique 3D maps of forests normally hidden from human sight.\n\nLess than 2% of sunlight reaches the forest floor in these regions, yet Biomass will study them in unsurpassed detail from a height of more than 600km. More importantly, the mission will allow scientists to calculate how much carbon is stored in the forests and measure how levels are changing as humans continue to cut down trees in the tropics and increase carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\nIn addition, Biomass – which has been built by a consortium led by Airbus UK and funded by the European Space Agency (Esa) – will map the sub-surface geology and topography of forest floors while it will also provide data about the rate at which biodiversity is being lost as forests are cleared for mining and agriculture.\n\n“We need to know the health of our tropical forests,” Simonetta Cheli, director of Earth Observation Programmes for Esa, told the Observer last week: “We need to know the quality and diversity of its vegetation and the amount of carbon stored there. To get that information we are going to create 3D images of them – from the top of the forest canopy to the roots of its trees.”\n\nTropical forests play a crucial role in protecting the planet from some of the worst effects of global warming because they absorb so much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere: estimates suggest they take up about eight billion tonnes and are often described as the Earth’s green lungs.\n\nBut deforestation and environmental degradation are now reversing this effect. Carbon, once stored in vast amounts, is being put back into the atmosphere, adding to growing levels of greenhouse gases. Hotspots include northern regions of South America, sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia and the Pacific where increased production of beef, soya, coffee, cacao, palm oil and timber are triggering widespread deforestation.\n\nQuantifying the problem is essential for forecasting what is going to happen to Earth’s climate in coming years, said Bjorn Rommen, mission scientist for the Biomass project: “We don’t properly understand what changes are now taking place, partly because we do not have accurate estimations of carbon levels in these forests. Biomass is going to help us to get a better grip on those numbers.”\n\nBiomass is scheduled to be launched from Esa’s spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana on 29 April on a VegaC rocket and will carry a radar known as a P-band synthetic aperture radar. Its use of long wavelength signals will allow it to peer down through canopies in order to assess how much carbon is stored on the floor and branches of the trees in the world’s tropical forests and to assess how levels are changing. This type of radar has never been flown in space before and has required Biomass to be fitted with a giant 12m antenna which will be deployed as the spacecraft begins its sweep over the Earth.\n“What the mission will do, effectively, is weigh the forests it studies,” said the leader of the Biomass science team, Prof Shaun Quegan, of Sheffield University. “We know half that weight must be made up of carbon. So we are going to be able to weigh the carbon content of the world’s tropical forests from space and, crucially, work out how much these are changing over time. We will then know the balance of carbon that is flowing to and from the atmosphere. That is enormously important.”\n\nThis point was backed by Cheli. “We need to be able to predict what the Earth will look like as temperatures rise. So we are going to integrate its data with AI and with other digital elements of machine learning and that will tell us what is likely to happen in future. It will tell us what we are up against.”", "sentences": ["A new space mission will launch the Biomass satellite to map carbon levels in the world's most inaccessible tropical forests.", "Using a revolutionary P-band radar, the spacecraft will create 3D images of dense forest canopies across Africa, Asia, and South America to monitor vegetation and underground structures.", "Scientists aim to assess how much carbon these forests store and how deforestation is impacting global carbon emissions.", "This data will help improve climate forecasts by clarifying the carbon flow between Earth’s forests and the atmosphere.", "The five-year mission, funded by the European Space Agency and led by Airbus UK, will also examine biodiversity loss due to agriculture and mining.", "By integrating satellite data with AI, researchers hope to predict future environmental changes with greater accuracy."]}

So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?\n\nHayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.\n\nThe 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.\n\nBut Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.\n\nAs Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.\n\nThey launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.\n\nIt was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.\n\nThe reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO. Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".\n\n\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.\n\nJSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".\nThe group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.\n\nBut it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption – and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at £1.1 million.\n\nJust Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR). XR – founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\". They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.\n\nThe spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious. Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached £37m.\n\nAnd behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics. Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.\n\nIt became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\". They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.\n\nThe group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.\nThe dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.\n\nThe police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" – chaining or gluing yourself to something – and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime – providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.\n\nIn the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.\n\nSenior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" – as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.\n\nJSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.\n\nThe government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"\n\nAnd the group's wider goal – to end the production of oil and gas – has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.\nIn the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"\n\nThat's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.\n\n\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.\n\n\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.\n\nJSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".\n\nThat is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.\n\nJSO has said its last protest – to be held at the end of April – will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it.

The aim of this experimental new scheme, launched by the waste collection department in the town in north eastern France, was to reduce food waste.\n\nThe project had been in the works for some time. The then-president of Colmar Agglomération (a role similar to a mayor), Gilbert Meyer, had been reelected in 2014 with the slogan \"one family, one hen\", which aimed to encourage residents to adopt a chicken. The following year the operation was launched, in partnership with two nearby chicken farms. Residents were encouraged to think of the free eggs – the effort put into raising a chicken would pay off quickly.\n\nMore than 200 homes in four municipalities signed up and were given two chickens each – either red chickens (Poulet Rouge) or Alsace chickens, an old and local breed.\n\nEach household signed a pledge committing to raising the chickens, with the understanding that the waste department could conduct welfare spot checks on the animals at any time. Henhouses were not provided; it was up to the residents to build or buy their own. The department ensured that each home had enough space for the hens – between 8 and 10 sq m (86 and 108 sq ft).\n\nThe scheme was a success – and is still underway. \"Over the years, other municipalities have joined and since 2022 all 20 municipalities of the agglomération have participated,\" says Eric Straumann, current president of the Colmar Agglomération.\n\nTo date, 5,282 hens have been distributed to local residents, and applications are currently open for the next round of distribution in June 2025. Not only have the residents received a plentiful supply of free eggs, but food waste has also been averted from landfill as chickens are fed kitchen scraps which would otherwise be thrown away.\n\n\"Considering that a hen has a life expectancy of four years on average and that she consumes 150g (5.3oz) of bio-waste per day, we estimate that we have avoided 273.35 tonnes of bio-waste [since 2015],\" says Straumann.\nFood waste contributes more methane emissions to the atmosphere than any other landfilled materials, due to its quick decay rate. In the US, around 58% of methane emissions released into the atmosphere from waste landfills are from food waste. Although shorter-lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane has a global warming impact more than 80 times higher than CO2 over a 20-year period. \n\nAround one third of food produced for humans is lost or wasted globally, amounting to 1.3 billion tonnes per year. Food loss and waste account for 8-10% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions – which is nearly five times the total emissions from the aviation sector.\n\nEven though chicken owners in the UK have been advised to avoid to feeding the birds kitchen scraps due to concerns about spreading disease, it's perfectly legal to do so elsewhere in the world, and it can have a meaningful impact on reducing food waste – and kickstart a cycle that benefits everyone.\n\"Proposed with the aim of reducing food waste, chickens make it possible to promote traditional circular economy practices that are still relevant today, particularly in villages, and which are now developing even in urban areas: chickens fed on our food waste in return provide us with fresh eggs,\" says Straumann.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the chickens can teach children in Colmar about animals and the importance of protecting the natural world, he adds.\nColmar is not the only town to hand out free birds – nor was it the first to do so. In 2012 in another a small north-western French town called Pincé, ­two chickens were offered to each household to help them cut down on organic waste. \"To begin with it was a joke, but then we realised it was a very good idea,\" Lydie Pasteau, the mayor of Pincé, told local media at the time. A total of 31 families were given chickens, along with a bag of feed, with Pasteau calling the scheme a \"surprising\" success. \n\nIn Belgium, chickens have been handed out in the cities of Mouscron and Antwerp and the province of Limburg, although residents had to sign an agreement not to eat the chickens for at least two years. More than 2,500 families adopted hens in one year alone in Limburg, according to some reports, while in Mouscron, 50 pairs of chickens were given out in the second round of the scheme, after the initial giveaway was a success. Residents, who had to prove they had sufficient space in their gardens to keep the birds, were given basic instructions on chicken keeping.\nIn theory, the scheme seems like a good idea, especially in parts of the world where eggs are either in shortage or very expensive. In California or New York, for example, a dozen eggs cost around $9 (£7). As some chicken breeds can lay up to 300 eggs every year, one chicken could lay up to $225 (£178) worth of eggs each year.\n\nIn practice though, Paul Behrens, a professor at the University of Oxford focusing on food systems, says there are some hurdles in the way: \"I'm sure it could be done in the UK but I'm not sure it's a good idea,\" he says. \"Bird flu is an ever-present worry. Current regulations mean you have to keep birds in fenced areas or indoors – this may again be a problem for animal welfare, or even disease spread if people don't do this.\"\n\nThe idea wouldn't work well in the US either, says Mark Bomford, director of Yale University's sustainable food programme. \"I love chickens, but I don't love the sound of this, especially in the US,\" Bomford says.\n\nThe US is currently experiencing an egg shortage due to an outbreak of bird flu – and as a result egg prices have skyrocketed 36% compared to 2023 – but handing out free chickens would not be an \"appropriate\" response, Bomford says.\n\n\"Economically, steep inflation for a basic grocery item like eggs hurts the poor far more than it hurts the rich. To care for chickens you need feed, water, housing, space and free time,\" he says. \"Most people with lower incomes don't have access to these things. By the time you have factored in all these costs, chickens are rarely 'free' and few people realise any net cost savings on eggs.\"\nOne couple, however, did come up with a unique solution – renting chickens. Christine and Brian Templeton of Rent The Chicken in New Hampshire provide hens, feed and support for six months, allowing customers to collect fresh eggs at home. Business, the couple reports, is booming.\n\nIt's important to temper egg expectations though, warns Behrens – industrial birds lay far more eggs than a home-kept healthy bird would. \"Common and modern egg-laying birds are often in huge pain their entire lives, partly due to their genetics which are centred on providing as much 'output' as possible,\" he says. \"If you use older breeds and allow them to live a long, healthy life then you can avoid many of the most egregious animal welfare issues.\"\n\n\"But people should then understand the tradeoff and expectations around that, you are having a much healthier bird in return for fewer eggs,\" he says.\n\nAnd from a food waste perspective, the ideal thing is to simply not waste the food in the first place – some researchers believe that composting can actually increase food waste.\n\n\"They think 'oh, it's okay as we compost',\" says Behrens. \"Which is better than nothing but much worse than not wasting things in the first place. It could be even worse with chickens because you are getting eggs from them. People might waste even more than if they composted.\"\n\nBut one unexpected benefit that was observed in Colmar – that had nothing to do with eggs or food waste – was the community the chickens created. Residents would bond over raising the chickens and would work with neighbours to care for the chickens when they went on holiday. \"Residents have welcomed this operation since its launch,\" says Straumann. \"And that's why all the municipalities in Colmar still participate in our programme today.\"", "sentences": ["Several towns in France and Belgium have launched successful programs giving away free chickens to residents to reduce food waste and promote sustainability.", "Colmar, France, has led one such initiative since 2015, distributing over 5,000 hens and preventing more than 270 tonnes of bio-waste from going to landfill, while also building community connections.", "Chickens eat kitchen scraps and provide fresh eggs, supporting a circular economy model, though concerns about bird flu and legal restrictions limit the feasibility of such schemes in countries like the UK and the US.", "Critics argue that maintaining chickens requires time, resources, and proper facilities, which may not be accessible to lower-income households.", "Alternatives like chicken rentals have emerged, offering a temporary and supported solution for egg production.", "Despite limitations, the initiative shows how small, local actions can foster environmental awareness and community engagement."]}

However, water entered the property for five hours,\" she says.\n\n\"It reached to the top of the skirting boards. We had to have all the flooring, woodwork and lower kitchen replaced, which took nearly 12 months.\"\n\nTheir final insurance bill was around £45,000. \nShe says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk.\n\nAlthough she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. \"We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm.\n\n\"We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk.

They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively.\n\nThe new NaFRA data shows as many as 6.3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050.\n\n\"We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data... as well as improved modelling and technological advances,\" says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency.\n\n\"When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century.\"\n\nThe Environment Agency plans to launch a portal where users can check their long-term flood risk.\n\nSimilar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI.\n\n\"We can no longer rely on historical data,\" says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X.\n\nThe London-based climate risk firm offers a digital twin of the Earth, which simulates different extreme weather events and their potential impact on properties, infrastructure and assets under different emissions scenarios.\n\nIt combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models.\n\n\"While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don't say what happens when that water hits the ground,\" he says.\n\n\"Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be.\"\n\nWhile banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments.\n\n\"They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,\" says Mr Ahmed.\nMany parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK.\n\nIn the US in January, devastating wild fires tore through parts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit west Florida.\n\nTo help insurers manage those costs, New York-based Faura analyses the resilience of homes and commercial buildings.\n\n\"We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,\" says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes.\n\n\"We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,\" he adds.\n\nFaura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports.\n\n\"Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,\" says Mr Holmes.\nOther services are popping up for homebuyers. For the properties it markets, US firm Redfin, estimates the percentage chance of natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfires, occurring up to the next 30 years across each property.\n\n\"If people are looking at two homes with the same layout in the same neighbourhood, then climate risk will make or break [their decision],\" says Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather.\n\nAs for Ms Sneddon, following her personal experience, she now works for flood risk company The FPS Group.\n\n\"Flood risk is only going to get worse over the coming years so it is essential to find out as much as you can about the flood risk to a property,\" she advises.\n\n\"Flooding has a huge impact on communities and mental health.

{"doc_id": "article_056", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "A new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belém. It aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November. The state government touts the highway's \"sustainable\" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact. The Amazon plays a vital role in absorbing carbon for the world and providing biodiversity, and many say this deforestation contradicts the very purpose of a climate summit. Along the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side - a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Belém. Diggers and machines carve through the forest floor, paving over wetland to surface the road which will cut through a protected area. Claudio Verequete lives about 200m from where the road will be. He used to make an income from harvesting açaí berries from trees that once occupied the space. \"Everything was destroyed,\" he says, gesturing at the clearing. \"Our harvest has already been cut down. We no longer have that income to support our family.\" He says he has received no compensation from the state government and is currently relying on savings. He worries the construction of this road will lead to more deforestation in the future, now that the area is more accessible for businesses. \"Our fear is that one day someone will come here and say: 'Here's some money. We need this area to build a gas station, or to build a warehouse.' And then we'll have to leave. \"We were born and raised here in the community. Where are we going to go?\" His community won't be connected to the road, given its walls on either side. \"For us who live on the side of the highway, there will be no benefits. There will be benefits for the trucks that will pass through. If someone gets sick, and needs to go to the centre of Belém, we won't be able to use it.\" The road leaves two disconnected areas of protected forest. Scientists are concerned it will fragment the ecosystem and disrupt the movement of wildlife. Prof Silvia Sardinha is a wildlife vet and researcher at a university animal hospital that overlooks the site of the new highway. She and her team rehabilitate wild animals with injuries, predominantly caused by humans or vehicles. Once healed, they release them back into the wild – something she says will be harder if there is a highway on their doorstep. \"From the moment of deforestation, there is a loss. \"We are going to lose an area to release these animals back into the wild, the natural environment of these species,\" she said. \"Land animals will no longer be able to cross to the other side too, reducing the areas where they can live and breed.\" The Brazilian president and environment minister say this will be a historic summit because it is \"a COP in the Amazon, not a COP about the Amazon\". The president says the meeting will provide an opportunity to focus on the needs of the Amazon, show the forest to the world, and present what the federal government has done to protect it. But Prof Sardinha says that while these conversations will happen \"at a very high level, among business people and government officials\", those living in the Amazon are \"not being heard\". The state government of Pará had touted the idea of this highway, known as Avenida Liberdade, as early as 2012, but it had repeatedly been shelved because of environmental concerns. Now a host of infrastructure projects have been resurrected or approved to prepare the city for the COP summit. Adler Silveira, the state government's infrastructure secretary, listed this highway as one of 30 projects happening in the city to \"prepare\" and \"modernise\" it, so \"we can have a legacy for the population and, more importantly, serve people for COP30 in the best possible way\". Speaking to the BBC, he said it was a \"sustainable highway\" and an \"important mobility intervention\". He added it would have wildlife crossings for animals to pass over, bike lanes and solar lighting. New hotels are also being built and the port is being redeveloped so cruise ships can dock there to accommodate excess visitors. Brazil's federal government is investing more than $81m (£62m) to expand the airport capacity from \"seven to 14 million passengers\". A new 500,000 sq-m city park, Parque da Cidade, is under construction. It will include green spaces, restaurants, a sports complex and other facilities for the public to use afterwards. Some business owners in the city's vast open-air Ver-o-peso market agree that this development will bring opportunities for the city. \"The city as a whole is being improved, it is being repaired and a lot of people are visiting from other places. It means I can sell more and earn more,\" says Dalci Cardoso da Silva, who runs a leather shoe stall. He says this is necessary because when he was young, Belém was \"beautiful, well-kept, well cared for\", but it has since been \"abandoned\" and \"neglected\" with \"little interest from the ruling class\". João Alexandre Trindade da Silva, who sells Amazonian herbal medicines in the market, acknowledges that all construction work can cause problems, but he felt the future impact would be worth it. \"We hope the discussions aren't just on paper and become real actions. And the measures, the decisions taken, really are put into practice so that the planet can breathe a little better, so that the population in the future will have a little cleaner air.\" That will be the hope of world leaders too who choose to attend the COP30 summit.

{"doc_id": "article_057", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "The UK government has launched a consultation on plans to replace the windfall tax on the profits of energy companies when it comes to an end in 2030. The Energy Profits Levy (EPL) was introduced in May 2022 after companies recorded skyrocketing profits due to a sharp rise in energy prices. It was increased in the most recent UK government budget last year and means oil and gas producers are paying a headline tax rate of 78%. The consultation seeks views on a new tax which would be triggered either when energy prices or profits are exceptionally high. The department for energy security and net zero said it would work to develop a plan that would deliver a \"fair return for the nation during times of unusually high prices\". And it pledged to consult on a \"new regime\" for the industry in the North Sea, confirming new licences for oil and gas fields would not be approved. That comes after the UK government admitted plans for the Rosebank oil field off Shetland had been approved unlawfully after the decision was challenged in court by environmental campaigners. The Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \"The North Sea will be at the heart of Britain's energy future. For decades, its workers, businesses and communities have helped power our country and our world. Oil and gas production will continue to play an important role and, as the world embraces the drive to clean energy, the North Sea can power our plan for change and clean energy future in the decades ahead.\" Oil and gas companies had posted record profits after wholesale prices spiked amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The EPL was introduced by the previous Conservative government, which set the rate at 25% and put it in place until 2025. It was later increased to 35% by then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt and would run until at least 2029. Current chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that had been extended until at least 2030 and increased again by 3% in October 2024. The latest rise prompted the US-based firm Apache to announce it would end its North Sea operations by 2029. The company described the financial impact as \"onerous,\" adding continuing to operate in the area would be \"uneconomic\". The price per barrel of oil has since fallen significantly. Trade association Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) previously warned the tax increase would stifle investment in the sector. Its chief executive, David Whitehouse, welcomed the news. He said: \"Today's consultations, on both the critical role of the North Sea in the energy transition and how the taxation regime will respond to unusually high oil and gas prices, will help to begin to give certainty to investors and create a stable investment environment for years to come.\" Alongside oil and gas production, the government said it wanted to ensure the North Sea would become a \"world-leading example\" for offshore clean energy. It said it was \"committed\" to working with the sector, trade unions and other organisations on a \"phased transition\" for the oil and gas industry. However, energy minister Michael Shanks was unable to guarantee new discoveries of oil wells near current licenced sites would not be exploited. The industry has been calling for flexibility if oil wells spread into nearby areas which are not licenced while current permits remain in place. Shanks said he would \"not be drawn\" on individual applications. He said: \"We've been really clear, we're clear in our manifesto, we're clear now in this consultation, it says in black and white no new licences to explore new fields.\" The department for energy security and net zero said \"tens of thousands\" of more jobs could created in offshore renewables. It said the denial of future oil and gas exploration licences was required to keep global warming to the target of 1.5C, but said it would \"engage\" with the sector on how to manage existing fields for the remainder of their lifespan. Mel Evans, climate team leader at Greenpeace UK, said: \"Our over-reliance on volatile and expensive fossil fuels is the reason our energy bills have remained so high in recent years. With yet more uncertain times ahead, this is a step worth celebrating from the government. The only way forward for a secure future means ending our reliance on oil and gas. The government clearly recognises that creating a renewable energy system can provide this country and its energy workers with economic opportunities and stable, future-proofed jobs.\" Tessa Khan, executive director of environmental campaign group Uplift, said the plans were \"long overdue\". She said: \"The government is right to draw a line under new licensing, which won't slow the decline in jobs or boost the UK's energy supply. This government now needs to make sure the transition to clean energy delivers for those workers and communities that are currently tied to the declining oil and gas industry. That means creating more good, secure jobs and new industries like wind manufacturing and decommissioning in the places that need them.\" The Unite union said it welcomed the government's plans, but warned it must be more than a \"listening exercise\". They said any future proposals must be backed up by the creation of \"large numbers of highly skilled, well paid jobs\". General secretary Sharon Graham said further investment in green technology was needed to create jobs before new licences for oil and gas fields were put on hold. She said: \"We urgently need investment in wind manufacturing and other green technologies to create the well paid, highly skilled jobs which are regularly promised but rarely delivered. Until that happens, we need to resist any calls that amount to offshoring our carbon responsibilities for the sake of virtue signalling.

Every year, thousands of these birds migrate from breeding grounds in northern Russia to the UK to avoid getting caught in the ice and snow of the arctic winter. However, they no longer need to travel as far to reach ice-free wetlands, with only 87 Bewick's swans returning to the reserve this year, without any cygnets in tow. The Bewick's have been studied at WWT Slimbridge for about 50 years with more than 10,000 swans being recorded - making it one of the longest single-species studies ever researched. However, warmer temperatures in Europe mean the swans are now cutting their 2174-mile (3,500km) journeys short in comfortable climates along the way. Early figures suggest more than 7,000 Bewick's \"short-stopped\" their migration this winter, in parts of Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, according to WWT. Reserve manager at WWT Slimbridge, Martin McGill, said their absence at the reserve this year had been \"concerning\". \"Bewick's swans are hugely important to our history here at WWT, and it's almost impossible to imagine Slimbridge without them,\" he said. \"We love welcoming them back each winter so it's terribly sad to see so few of them this year and without any cygnets.\" Mr McGill explained that Bewick's swans also faced dangers on their migration route from toxic lead poisoning and illegal shooting. \"We make sure the Bewick's swans have everything they need while they're with us, but we know they face challenges on their migrations and at their breeding grounds,\" Mr McGill continued. \"We need more wetlands to help us reverse the impacts of climate change and prevent situations like this from happening in future.\" WWT is now leading a coalition of charities urging the UK government to take swift action to ban the sale and use of lead ammunition to protect these birds from needlessly painful deaths.", "sentences": ["Climate change is causing a significant drop in the number of Bewick’s swans migrating to the UK, with only 87 returning to the Slimbridge reserve this year and no cygnets among them.", "The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) has recorded an 86% decline in their population at the site over nearly 50 years.", "Warmer European winters allow the swans to stop their migration earlier in countries like Denmark and the Netherlands.", "The swans also face dangers from lead poisoning and illegal shooting during their migration.", "WWT is urging the UK government to ban lead ammunition to protect the species.", "They also stress the need for more wetlands to counteract climate change and support migratory birds."]}
{"doc_id": "article_059", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is. They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies. But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen. Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes. A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma. Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation. \"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says. Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas. While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation. Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture. But methane is not always easy to notice. It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light. Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful. \"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative. There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities. Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says. At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms. Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions. He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view. With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs. Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges. Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover. \"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible. Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November. It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding. Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024. With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\" It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring. Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well. For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes. In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts. Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS. In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses. However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback. And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\" At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.", "sentences": ["Detecting methane is essential due to its impact on both health and climate, yet it remains challenging to monitor.", "Community efforts, like those in Washington DC, are revealing alarming methane levels using portable sensors, linking emissions to health issues such as asthma.", "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, significantly contributing to global warming despite its shorter lifespan compared to CO2.", "Advances in satellite technology, like Carbon Mapper’s Tanager-1 and MethaneSAT, are improving high-resolution detection of large emitters and hard-to-reach sources.", "Still, translating detection into action is slow—only 1% of the alerts from the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) have led to confirmed responses.", "Experts remain hopeful that as technology and communication improve, both detection and mitigation will increase in effectiveness."]}

They have drawn up a wanted list of long-lost varieties linked to local places, such as the vibrant \"bonfire yellow\" daffodil associated with bonfire nights in Sussex. Rare varieties could be lost if they're not found and cared for, said Gwen Hines of the plant conservation charity, Plant Heritage. \"There's the joy that they bring to all of us in the springtime ... and also, in the future, they might be important for medicines for science,\" she said. Believed to have been brought to Britain by the Romans, daffodils are a source of galantamine, a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The much-loved plants have been bred for centuries and now come in a dazzling array of about 30,000 different shapes, sizes and colours. Most daffodils are yellow but some are white, orange and salmon-pink. The gardening charity, the RHS, is asking for help in finding rare and missing daffodils that are feared lost to history and science. The Sussex bonfire is named after the famous bonfire night in the Sussex county town of Lewes. The daffodil is one of many bred by the local plant breeder, Noel Burr, but has not been seen for at least 20 years. It is known for its very bright orange-yellow flower. Sussex horticulturist Roger Parsons hopes it is still growing in a garden somewhere. \"Perhaps someone planted it in their garden and it still exists but our challenge is to find that person,\" he said. \"Finding this and other daffodils thought to be lost helps maintain those genes for future plant breeding.\" This daffodil is one of many bred by the plantswoman Sarah Backhouse. It was named for her by her husband after her death in 1921. The daffodil is unusual in being one of the first daffodils with a pinkish colour. It has a salmon-pink trumpet surrounded by ivory flowers. The daffodil is known to exist in national collections but its actual whereabouts are unknown. Daffodils were fashionable in late Victorian and Edwardian times, bred into different shapes and forms. William Fowler Copeland (1872 to 1953) is a particularly well-known daffodil breeder from this time. He named this white, double-flowered daffodil after his wife. The RHS is also calling on the public to record where and when they see daffodils appearing this spring. RHS scientist Dr Kálmán Könyves has spent 15 years studying \"these remarkably fascinating plants\". He said mapping which daffodils grow where will help us find out how the plants are responding to the changing climate. \"With this we can get some data on whether the flowering time changes as our climate changes,\" he said.", "sentences": ["Experts and conservationists are searching for rare British daffodil varieties that may still exist in gardens or parks but have not been seen in decades.", "Varieties like the bright orange-yellow 'Sussex bonfire' and a rare pinkish daffodil named after Sarah Backhouse are among those feared lost.", "These daffodils are important not only for their beauty but also for their potential use in medicine, such as Alzheimer's treatment.", "The RHS and Plant Heritage are urging the public to help locate these flowers and document where daffodils bloom this spring.", "Tracking their presence and flowering patterns may also reveal how climate change is affecting them.", "Preserving these varieties helps maintain genetic diversity crucial for future plant breeding."]}
{"doc_id": "article_061", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed. It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change. The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced. The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events. \"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author. \"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\" The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast. Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January. This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations. It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events. They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires. The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then. By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events. In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years. This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming. \"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution. \"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\" The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season. By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850. The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping. Another key element is drought. Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale. The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires. However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection. Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise. \"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team. \"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement. The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely. That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\" The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires. This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year – the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.", "sentences": ["A new study confirms that climate change significantly increased the likelihood of the extreme heat and dryness that fueled devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.", "Researchers from World Weather Attribution found that such conditions are now about 35% more likely due to global warming, with fire-prone weather expected once every 17 years.", "They also observed that the fire season has lengthened by around 23 days and that drought conditions in LA are now over twice as likely as before widespread fossil fuel use.", "While other factors contribute to wildfires, scientists are confident that rising temperatures and prolonged dry spells are making intense fire events more common.", "Satellite data, climate models, and real-world observations align to support these findings.", "The study adds urgency to addressing climate change, especially as overlapping dry seasons and Santa Ana winds amplify fire risks in the region."]}

The team of scientists analysed soil samples from farms in Yorkshire, Cumbria and West Sussex, to find out how carbon storage under hedgerows compared to that found in adjacent intensively managed grass fields. The research found that soil under hedges stored on average 40 tonnes more carbon per hectare than grassland. Dr Sofia Biffi, a research fellow in agricultural ecosystems, said the results showed hedgerows could have a positive impact on soil health and soil carbon storage. \"In the past few years, we have witnessed how farmers are engaging with hedge planting. They can see the difference that hedges make to the biodiversity on their farms,\" she said. \"They see more birds, bats and pollinators, and they enjoy their flowers, wood and shade. And now they can also know they are playing their part in storing more carbon in the soil.\" The results were published in the journal Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment. Dairy farmer and England chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, James Robinson, said it was \"good to have the science to back up what we farmers already know\". He said: \"There is an ever-growing list of reasons to plant and manage hedgerows, from livestock health, crop protection and biosecurity, through to carbon storage. Hedgerows should be seen as a huge asset both to farmers and the landscape and if we manage them in the right way, using traditional hedge laying techniques, we can make them an eternal feature of our rural landscape.\" The team compromised researchers from the University of Leeds School of Geography and the University of Sheffield's School of Biosciences. They said the data could be used to predict the impact of planting new hedgerows on the UK's net zero targets. About half of Britain's hedgerows were lost between the 1940s and 1990s, mostly in England, due to intensive farming and development. According to the Woodland Trust, around 118,000 miles of hedgerows disappeared in that time. While the loss has slowed since the 1990s, neglect, damage and removal remain big threats. Study co-author professor Pippa Chapman said existing hedgerows needed to be maintained to ensure the carbon stored in the soil does not disappear into the atmosphere. She said: \"We have seen some important hedgerow planting commitments from the government, which we hope they will support farmers to achieve in the next few years. It is not only hedgerow planting that brings so many benefits to farmland but also maintaining the network of hedges and hedgerow trees that we already have. Planting, gapping-up, and hedge laying are all important actions that farmers can take to help protect the carbon stored in soil beneath hedges and the environment.\"", "sentences": ["A study by the University of Leeds found that hedgerows store significantly more carbon in the soil—about 40 tonnes more per hectare—compared to intensively managed grassland.", "Researchers analyzed samples from farms across England, highlighting the environmental and biodiversity benefits of planting and maintaining hedges.", "Hedgerows not only support pollinators and wildlife but also help combat climate change by boosting soil carbon levels.", "Experts emphasize that maintaining existing hedges is just as important as planting new ones to prevent stored carbon from being released.", "Around half of Britain's hedgerows were lost between the 1940s and 1990s, and continued neglect poses a threat.", "The findings support efforts to restore hedgerows as part of the UK’s net zero strategy and encourage traditional management practices like hedge laying."]}
{"doc_id": "article_063", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say. January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Niño. But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service. The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot. It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected. \"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News. \"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\" January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate. Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Niño weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures. This year, La Niña conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect. While La Niña is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures – it was expected to lead to a cooler January. \"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said. \"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\" A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated. One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Niño. While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Niña phase from 2020-23. The El Niño event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere. But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Niño ended. \"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife. The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus. \"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\" Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols. These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space. Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe. But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases. And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988. Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed. The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further. This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated. Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 – but the recent warmth means they can't be sure. What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet. \"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said. \"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"", "sentences": ["January 2025 was the warmest on record, defying expectations that it would be cooler than January 2024 due to the shift from El Niño to La Niña.", "Scientists from Copernicus and NASA attribute the overall trend to greenhouse gas emissions but remain puzzled by the magnitude of recent temperature increases.", "Several theories are being explored, including lingering effects from El Niño, reduced atmospheric aerosols, and possible changes in ocean behavior.", "The reduced presence of aerosols, which historically helped cool the planet, may now be revealing more of the underlying warming.", "Some researchers warn of a potential feedback loop involving ocean-driven cloud loss, though this remains speculative.", "While 2025 may still end up cooler than recent years, experts agree that without a major reduction in emissions, record-breaking warmth will continue."]}

Chief executive Anders Opedal said that the transition to lower carbon energy was moving slower than expected, costs had increased, and customers were reluctant to commit to long term contracts. Mr Opedal told the BBC he was confident that Rosebank - a giant new oil field in the North Sea - would go ahead, despite a recent court ruling that consent had been awarded unlawfully. He also warned that gas prices could rise next winter as European gas storage levels were lower now than this time last year. \"We are scaling down our investments in renewables and low carbon solutions because we don't see the necessary profitability in the future,\" Mr Opedal said. It will cut investments in renewables to $5bn over the next two years, down from about $10bn. It will also drop a target to spend half of its fixed assets budget on renewables and low carbon products by 2030. By contrast, Equinor will be increasing oil and gas production by 10% over the next two years. The controversial Rosebank oil field is thought to hold 500 million barrels of oil. A Scottish court recently ruled that consent had been granted unlawfully as the application did not account for the full environmental impact of the project. Many within the UK government - including the Energy Secretary Ed Miliband - are opposed to it. Mr Opedal acknowledged it was a divisive issue but insisted it was good for the UK economy. \"This is an important project for us. It provides local jobs in Scotland, local jobs in the UK, so we think this project will move forward,\" he said. \"We think that Western Europe and the UK should produce the oil and gas it uses instead of being dependent on other countries outside Europe.\" Climate campaigners and the oil industry both claimed victory at the Supreme Court ruling as although the consent was revoked, the court allowed preparatory work to continue on Rosebank while new consents are sought. The government said it has \"already consulted\" on emissions from burning extracted oil and gas, and will incorporate the results of the consultation when making revisions to environmental guidance. \"Our priority is to deliver a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations, which drives towards our clean energy future of energy security, lower bills, and good, long-term jobs,\" the spokesperson added. Tessa Khan, from the environmental campaign group Uplift which, along with Greenpeace, brought judicial reviews to stop the development of Rosebank, said Equinor was getting ahead of itself. \"I think it's in the industry's interest to make it sound like it's a tick box exercise to get Rosebank over the line,\" she said. \"There is a regulatory process that needs to be satisfied, and there are very strong public interest arguments against developing Rosebank, so we don't think it will be a straightforward decision at all.\" She added that new oil and gas fields will not bring down UK bills or improve UK energy security, as renewables would, because the oil is drilled and sold for export. \"I think we should be honest about whether or not oil and gas companies are good faith partners in the energy transition and interested in lowering people's energy bills. I think the answer now is very clearly 'no',\" she said. Equinor follows other energy companies in reducing investment in renewables. Shell and BP have both scaled back their future plans. Mr Opedal appeared to welcome Donald Trump's invitation to the industry to \"drill, baby, drill\" but said energy prices, not the US president, would dictate future exploration and production. \"When I hear 'drill, baby, drill', I see that as a positive sentiment to the oil and gas business but I think companies will always decide on drilling programs based on price signals,\" said Mr Opedal. \"If prices go down, less wells will be drilled, if it goes up, more will be drilled.\" When asked how this was compatible with his target to make Equinor net zero by 2050, he conceded that drilling more now would make it harder in later years. Mr Opedal also warned that low levels of gas storage in Europe as it exits this winter could mean higher prices next year. \"Gas storage levels will be lower this spring, meaning that Europe will need to fill up larger amounts of gas to keep it at the same level,\" Mr Opedal added. \"The increase in underlying demand for gas from China means more competition for energy which has the potential to increase prices.\"", "sentences": ["Equinor, Norway's major energy company, is cutting its renewable energy investments by half, citing poor profitability and slow progress in the green energy transition.", "While it reduces its green spending to $5 billion over two years, it plans to increase oil and gas production by 10%, including the controversial Rosebank oil field in the North Sea.", "Despite a court ruling that Rosebank’s approval was unlawful, Equinor remains confident the project will proceed, emphasizing its economic benefits.", "Climate activists argue that new oil projects will not reduce UK energy bills or improve energy security, as the extracted oil is intended for export.", "The company follows similar moves by Shell and BP in pulling back from renewables, raising concerns about the sincerity of energy firms in supporting net-zero goals.", "Equinor's CEO also warned that Europe's low gas storage levels and growing competition from China could lead to higher gas prices next winter."]}
{"doc_id": "article_065", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters. It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration. They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change. Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean? The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator. Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas. The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be. As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues. But Amoc appears to be getting weaker. We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change. But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree. One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time. Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world. A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit. This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past. Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall. As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics. Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse. \"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London. No one really knows how close it may be. In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken. But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable. Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc. \"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office. But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\". Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks. That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration. \"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter. Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds. Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects. \"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson. That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change. A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation […] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton. While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade. In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold … like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns. \"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\" There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts. \"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton. \"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India. How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments. Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur. But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning. Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. \"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England. \"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse. \"And so I think people need to not give up, because there's so much to be gained by reducing emissions. \"The scale of change is just so much worse if we do nothing.\"", "sentences": ["Scientists are increasingly concerned that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), which keeps the UK and north-west Europe warm, could weaken or collapse due to climate change.", "Although the probability of a full collapse this century is uncertain, recent studies suggest the risk may be greater than previously thought, potentially as high as 10–20%.", "A weakening or collapse of Amoc could lead to drastically colder winters in the UK and major disruptions to global weather patterns, including the monsoons.", "Contributing factors include increased freshwater from melting Greenland ice and reduced ocean salinity, which prevent the normal sinking of water needed for circulation.", "Despite uncertainties, scientists warn that the potential consequences are too serious to ignore and urge governments to prepare.", "Cutting greenhouse gas emissions remains the most effective way to reduce the risk of triggering this climate tipping point."]}
{"doc_id": "article_066", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations. The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines. The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London – but it eventually passed on Friday. Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\". Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel. But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions. The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting. It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel. Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus. The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia. Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO. There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships. The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive. \"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment. \"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said. In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process. Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce. \"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam. Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped. \"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu. Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups. \"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition. It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade. But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal. Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise. \"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said. Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types. \"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said. Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries. It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken. Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations. The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised. Now the committee have agreed the measure, it is expected to be formally adopted in October.", "sentences": ["After nearly a decade of negotiations, countries have agreed on a global deal to reduce shipping emissions, making it the first industry with internationally mandated emission reduction targets.", "Starting in 2028, ship owners will be required to use cleaner fuels or face fines of up to $380 per tonne of CO2, though a proposed blanket carbon tax was dropped.", "The deal faced resistance from Saudi Arabia, the US, and other fossil fuel-heavy nations, while small island states and environmental groups criticized it as too weak.", "The agreement could lead to an estimated 8% reduction in emissions by 2030, falling short of the IMO’s 20% target.", "A significant challenge remains the cost gap between cheap fossil fuels and expensive green alternatives like ammonia or e-kerosene.", "Funds from the penalties will support greener fuel development and assist developing nations, but experts agree more action will be needed to truly decarbonize the sector."]}

Developers say the two huge neighbouring battery farms - one at the site of a former opencast coal mine - will store enough electricity to power three million homes. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are being built across the UK to help balance the electricity grid, which is becoming increasingly powered by renewables. Almost 90% of the electricity generated in Scotland last year was from low carbon sources like wind, solar or nuclear, according to figures from the Scottish government. To help balance the peaks and troughs of renewables, the National Grid estimates that the UK would need to see BESS provision grow almost six times over by the end of the decade. The one gigawatt facility at Coalburn is being constructed in two phases. It will be charged using excess power from wind farms with the electricity being discharged when demand is high or renewable generation is low. The giant batteries will operate for two hours at a time before being depleted. Work on the first phase started in November 2023 and is due to be operational later this year. The developers - Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) - have confirmed that construction will begin shortly on stage two. Nischal Agarwal from CIP said the projects would enhance the the country's energy security. He added it would support the UK's pursuit of a clean power system by 2030 and deliver a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. Alongside the final investment decision for the Coalburn 2 site, CIP has also confirmed that work will begin soon on a similar sized battery farm near Kincardine in Fife. The Devilla site will take the company's total capacity up to 3GWh - enough to power 4.5 million homes for two hours. Visiting the Coalburn 1 site, first minister John Swinney said the investment would deliver a significant contribution to the growth of Scotland's energy transition infrastructure. \"By helping to supply reliable and secure power to our homes and businesses, well-located storage systems, such as batteries and pumped hydro storage, can move us closer to net zero and directly support the communities around them.\" The second phase of the Coalburn development is being built on the former Broken Cross open cast workings about four miles south of Lesmahagow.

{"doc_id": "article_068", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has come to an end, and it brought a number of particularly damaging storms.\n\nClimate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.\n\nBut warmer oceans and a warmer atmosphere can make those that do form even more intense, with potentially higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.\nWhat are hurricanes?\n\nHurricanes are powerful storms which develop in warm tropical ocean waters.\n\nIn other parts of the world, they are known as cyclones or typhoons. Collectively, these storms are referred to as \"tropical cyclones\".\nTropical cyclones are characterised by very high wind speeds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges - short-term rises to sea-levels. This often causes widespread damage and flooding.\n\nHurricanes can be categorised by their peak sustained wind speed.\n\nMajor hurricanes are rated category three and above, meaning they reach at least 111mph (178km/h).\nHow do hurricanes form?\n\nHurricanes, typhoons and cyclones begin as atmospheric disturbances - such as, for example, a tropical wave, an area of low pressure where thunderstorms and clouds develop.\n\nAs warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface, winds begin to spin. The process is linked to how the Earth's rotation affects winds in tropical regions just away from the equator.\n\n    Hurricanes: Inside the deadly storms\n\nFor a hurricane to develop and keep spinning, the sea surface generally needs to be at least 27C to provide enough energy, and the winds need to not vary much with height.\n\nIf all these factors come together, an intense hurricane can form, although the exact causes of individual storms are complex.\nHave hurricanes been getting worse?\n\nGlobally, the frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased over the past century, and in fact the number may have fallen - although long-term data is limited in some regions.\n\nBut it is \"likely\" that a higher proportion of tropical cyclones across the globe are reaching category three or above, meaning they reach the highest wind speeds, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. \nThe IPCC quotes \"medium confidence\" that there has been an increase in the average and peak rainfall rates associated with tropical cyclones.\n\nThe frequency and magnitude of \"rapid intensification events\" in the Atlantic has also likely increased. This is where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly, which can be especially dangerous.\n\nThere also seems to have been a slowdown in the speed at which tropical cyclones move across the Earth's surface. This typically brings more rainfall for a given location. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey \"stalled\" over Houston, releasing 100cm of rain in three days.\n\nIn some places, the average location where tropical cyclones reach their peak intensity has shifted poleward - for example the western North Pacific. This can expose new communities to these hazards.\n\nAnd there is some evidence the increased intensity of US hurricanes means they are causing more damage. \nIs climate change affecting hurricanes?\n\nAssessing the precise influence of climate change on individual tropical cyclones can be challenging due to the complexity of these storm systems.\n\nBut rising temperatures do affect these storms in several measurable ways.\n\nFirstly, warmer ocean waters mean storms can pick up more energy, leading to higher wind speeds.\n\nMaximum wind speeds of hurricanes between 2019 and 2023 were boosted by an estimated 19mph (30km/h) on average as a result of human-driven ocean warming, according to a recent study.\n\nSecondly, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall.\n\nClimate change made the extreme rainfall from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 around three times more likely, according to one estimate. \nFinally, sea-levels are rising, mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. Local factors can also play a part. This means storm surges happen on top of already elevated sea levels, worsening coastal flooding.\n\nFor example, it is estimated that flood heights from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - one of America's deadliest storms - were 15-60% higher than they would have been in the climate conditions of 1900.\n\nOverall, the IPCC concludes that there is \"high confidence\" that humans have contributed to increases in precipitation associated with tropical cyclones, and \"medium confidence\" that humans have contributed to the higher probability of a tropical cyclone being more intense\nHow might hurricanes change in the future?\n\nThe number of tropical cyclones globally is unlikely to increase, according to the IPCC.\n\nBut as the world warms, it says it is \"very likely\" they will have higher rates of rainfall and reach higher top wind speeds. This means a higher proportion would reach the most intense categories, four and five.\n\nThe more global temperatures rise, the more extreme these changes will tend to be.\n\nThe proportion of tropical cyclones reaching category four and five may increase by around 10% if global temperature rises are limited to 1.5C, increasing to 13% at 2C and 20% at 4C, the IPCC says - although the exact numbers are uncertain.", "sentences": ["While the total number of tropical cyclones like hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones is not expected to increase due to climate change, their intensity is likely to grow.", "Warmer oceans and a more humid atmosphere fuel stronger storms with higher wind speeds, more rainfall, and increased coastal flooding.", "The IPCC reports that a higher proportion of storms are reaching category three or above, and rapid intensification events have become more common.", "Rising sea levels and slower storm movement contribute to more severe flooding, as seen in storms like Hurricane Harvey and Katrina.", "Climate change is making such intense storms more probable, with stronger winds and rainfall.", "Looking ahead, a warming planet will likely cause a greater share of storms to reach the highest intensity levels, particularly if global temperatures rise beyond 1.", "5°C."]}

This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.\n\nWith 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.\n\nSouth Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades – and will build more instead.\n\nAnd France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.\n\nIn addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.\n\nThe White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.\n\nAlso at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.\n\nThis came after it was agreed in the final statement or “stocktake” of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be “accelerated” to help combat climate change.\n\nBut hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.\n\nYet AI relies on data – and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.\n\nIn September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania – the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.\n\nDespite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation’s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".\n\nOther tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs – a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.\n\nSMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.\n\nHinkley Point C is a good example. Britain’s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.\n\nIt is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country’s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to £9bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.\n\nIt is not an isolated case. The US’s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn – well over double their original budget.\n\nSMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.\n\nBut while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.\n\nOpinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.\n\n“Nuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.\n\n“It is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"\n\nOpponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.\n\nAccording to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is “a folly to consider nuclear energy as clean”. It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"\n\nIf current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nThe answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.\n\nSolving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.", "sentences": ["After years of decline, nuclear power is experiencing renewed interest driven by climate goals, energy security concerns, and demand from tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.", "Countries such as the US, UK, France, and South Korea are planning to expand or revive nuclear programs, with 31 nations aiming to triple nuclear power by 2050.", "Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are being promoted as a more affordable and scalable alternative to traditional nuclear plants, though they remain unproven commercially.", "Public opinion remains divided due to past nuclear accidents and unresolved issues like long-term radioactive waste disposal.", "Supporters argue that nuclear energy is essential for meeting carbon reduction targets, while critics highlight high costs and cleaner alternatives.", "The future of nuclear power may hinge on resolving waste management and proving the viability of new technologies like SMRs."]}

This is where most money has been given to date because it can often be profitable.\n\nMany countries still have coal power stations that are yet to reach the ends of their lives. They need support to switch to clean energy, such as solar farms.\n\nAdaptation\n\nThis is money to help developing nations prepare for the worst effects of climate change.\n\nIt is different to loss and damage as it is focused on the future.\n\nThe needs vary depending where in the world the country is, but may include:\n\n    building stronger flood defences\n    relocating populations at risk\n    developing storm proof housing\n    distributing crops that are more resilient to dry spells\n\nWhat has been given so far?\n\nIn 2009, richer countries agreed to provide $100bn (£78bn) a year to developing nations for climate action by the end of 2020.\n\nBut by the end of that year the total was $83.3bn (£65bn) - the goal was finally reached three years later.\n\nThe majority, 82%, of this money came from public funds, with the remainder from the private sector, according to the OECD.\n\nBut analysis, commissioned by the UN, suggests the private sector could deliver 70% of future investments needed to meet climate commitments. A coalition of more than 550 private firms have already committed to use $130tn of assets to help achieve net zero.\n\nOne study in 2018 estimated that developing countries would suffer between $290bn - $580bn (£226bn - £451bn) in damages by 2030, another put the cost at $400bn (£311bn). It is difficult to predict the exact amount, but it is clear the current size of the fund is too small to tackle the issue. \nWhat might countries agree in Baku at COP29?\n\nNegotiations on the new quantified goal have been happening for months between governments.\n\nAt the heart of these talks is how much money should be given.\n\nMany studies have tried to put a figure on it - the G77+ China alliance of developing countries has previously said at least $1.3tn (£1.14tn) needs to be mobilised by 2030.\n\nA UN committee on finance tried to combine all these estimates and earlier this year put the number as high as $6.9tn.\n\nIt is unlikely a figure in that region will be announced at Baku. Developed nations including the UK, have recently raised concerns they may not meet their previous pledges because of ongoing domestic economic issues.\n\nAnother key area of discussion is how the money will be given - the majority of the public funding, 69%, is still given in the form of loans rather than direct grants. This can increase the debt burden in poorer nations.\n\nNafkote Dabi, Oxfam International Climate Policy lead, has called this \"profoundly unfair\".\n\nHe said: \"Instead of supporting countries that are facing worsening droughts, cyclones and flooding, rich countries are crippling their ability to cope with the next shock and deepening their poverty.\"\n\nThe third big question on the table is who will contribute. Thirty years ago, it was agreed that developed countries should take on more of the financial burden because of their historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and the economic benefits they enjoyed from exploiting fossil fuels.\n\nBut since then, developing nations like China have grown economically and have a larger carbon footprint.

They can swim at speeds of around 10km per hour, due in part to their paws being slightly webbed\n\nIn the US, polar bears are classified as a threatened species; scientists say the biggest threat to their future is the continuing loss of sea ice habitat, which they depend on as a platform from which to pounce on their marine prey.\n\nPrevious research using collar cameras on bears has shown that, as they spend more of the year on land - when there is no available sea ice to hunt from - the bears are unable to find enough calories.\n\nDr Rode explained that polar bears are top predators: “Our study suggested that they're getting their exposure to some pathogens primarily through their prey species.\n\n“So what we saw as changes in pathogen exposure for polar bears is indicative of changes that other species are also experiencing.”", "sentences": ["As Arctic temperatures rise, polar bears are increasingly exposed to pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites that were once uncommon in their environment.", "A study analyzing blood samples from polar bears over a 30-year span revealed a significant increase in exposure to five specific pathogens linked to land-based animals, likely transmitted through their prey.", "The decline in sea ice has forced polar bears to spend more time on land, where they are more vulnerable to these diseases.", "Although polar bears are typically resilient to illness, the findings reflect broader ecological changes in the Arctic.", "The loss of sea ice also threatens their ability to hunt effectively, impacting their nutrition and survival.", "Researchers emphasize that the changes observed in polar bears suggest that other Arctic species may be facing similar health threats due to climate change."]}

{"doc_id": "article_083", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "After being absent for more than a century, salmon have been spotted in Oregon's Klamath River Basin, following a mammoth dam removal project in California.\n\nIn October, fish biologists at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife identified an autumn-run Chinook salmon in a tributary to the Klamath River, upstream from where the J C Boyle Dam once stood. It is the first anadromous fish (species that migrate from the sea upstream to spawn) to be seen in the state's Klamath Basin since 1912 – when the first of four hydroelectric dams was constructed.\n\nIn August, the last of the four dams were demolished following an arduous campaign by tribal communities, who hoped the dam removal would lead to the return of salmon – a vital source of food for the tribes living alongside the Klamath River.\n\n\"We saw a large fish the day before rise to surface in the Klamath River, but we only saw a dorsal fin,\" says Mark Hereford, project leader for Oregon's Klamath fisheries reintroduction programme. \"I thought, was that a salmon or maybe it was a very large rainbow trout?\" The team returned the following two days and were \"ecstatic\" to confirm that salmon were in the tributary.\n\nBut the salmon have also made a surprising early return further downstream the Klamath River, on tribal lands.\n\n\"I thought that there would be some fish returning above the dams this year,\" says Barry McCovey, senior fisheries biologist for the Yurok Tribe. \"But what's surprising is the sheer number of fish that are back, and the geographic range. I couldn't believe they'd been spotted in Oregon. It was incredible news to hear – it was mind boggling. When I heard, I was like 'wait, already?!' They've exceeded any expectations anyone had.\"\n\nThe headwaters of the Klamath River originate in Oregon, flowing through the Cascade Mountain Range, into Northern California, and emptying into the Pacific Ocean. Running 263 miles (423km), the river was once the third-largest salmon-producing river on the West Coast, and was a life force for numerous Native American tribes, such as the Yuroks – who are known as the \"salmon people\".\nBut the dams blocked fish migration, leading to mass fish die-offs and degraded water quality. Fall chinook salmon numbers plummeted by more than 90% compared to their pre-dam numbers and spring chinook by 98%. Steelhead trout, coho salmon and Pacific lamprey numbers also saw drastic declines, and the Klamath tribes in the upper basin have been without their salmon fishery for a century, since the completion of Copco 1 in 1922. Following a decades-long campaign by tribes, including the Yuroks and Karuks, the dams were demolished, with the last coming down in late August. The tribes are working with Oregon and California wildlife officials to monitor the return of anadromous fish, such as chinook and coho salmon, steelhead trout, and Pacific Lamprey to the Klamath basin post-dam removal.  Many weren't expecting to see the return of fish for years but biologists in California have also seen salmon in creeks that were formerly inaccessible when the dams were in place.\n\n\"The fish are spawning in these tributaries that nine months ago were 30ft (9.1m) underwater. It offers so much hope for the future,\" says McCovey. \"It makes me feel that we did the right thing, we're on the right path. The river is healing itself.\"\n\nThe dismantling of the dams was the largest dam-removal project in US history. The dams had been extremely unpopular with local tribes, who had campaigned for their removal since at least the 1990s. \"We were told it was never going to happen,\" says Brook Thompson, a Yurok tribal member and civil engineer who is involved in restoring the Klamath basin. \"We were told it was foolish to even ask for one removal – we were asking for four.\"\nFollowing years of failed negotiations, work started on removing the four California dams in 2023, and in August 2024, to the joy of local tribes, the final dam fell. It reopened more than 400 miles (644km) of river.\n\n\"Salmon returning to the upper Klamath River the same season as the dam removal has filled me with gratification and joy that I usually reserve for weddings and births,\" says Thompson. \"Seeing the videos of the salmon returning home brought me to tears of happiness and relief. We did it. I am filled with newfound energy and hope to keep up my work in restoration and supporting the rights of tribes and fish.\"\n\nThe Yurok Tribe's goal is to eventually restore the thriving salmon fishery they once had, and be able to host their annual salmon festival in August– with Klamath salmon, rather than having to import it from Alaska.\nTribes will continue to support the salmon as they have supported us all these generations,\" adds Thompson. \"My dream is that one day, my future descendants will be able to live the reality that my grandfather experienced in the early 1900s by seeing so many salmon he could walk across their backs to the other side.\"\n\nThe tribe is also restoring 2,200 acres (890ha) of land that is above ground for the first time in a century following the emptying of the four reservoirs.\n\n\"There'll be ups and downs, there won't be a straight line, we'll have setbacks,\" says McCovey. \"Any restoration project this big does.

This is where most money has been given to date because it can often be profitable.\n\nMany countries still have coal power stations that are yet to reach the ends of their lives. They need support to switch to clean energy, such as solar farms.\n\nAdaptation\n\nThis is money to help developing nations prepare for the worst effects of climate change.\n\nIt is different to loss and damage as it is focused on the future.\n\nThe needs vary depending where in the world the country is, but may include:\n\n    building stronger flood defences\n    relocating populations at risk\n    developing storm proof housing\n    distributing crops that are more resilient to dry spells\n\nWhat has been given so far?\n\nIn 2009, richer countries agreed to provide $100bn (£78bn) a year to developing nations for climate action by the end of 2020.\n\nBut by the end of that year the total was $83.3bn (£65bn) - the goal was finally reached three years later.\n\nThe majority, 82%, of this money came from public funds, with the remainder from the private sector, according to the OECD.\n\nBut analysis, commissioned by the UN, suggests the private sector could deliver 70% of future investments needed to meet climate commitments. A coalition of more than 550 private firms have already committed to use $130tn of assets to help achieve net zero.\n\nOne study in 2018 estimated that developing countries would suffer between $290bn - $580bn (£226bn - £451bn) in damages by 2030, another put the cost at $400bn (£311bn). It is difficult to predict the exact amount, but it is clear the current size of the fund is too small to tackle the issue. \n\nWhat might countries agree in Baku at COP29?\n\nNegotiations on the new quantified goal have been happening for months between governments.\n\nAt the heart of these talks is how much money should be given.\n\nMany studies have tried to put a figure on it - the G77+ China alliance of developing countries has previously said at least $1.3tn (£1.14tn) needs to be mobilised by 2030.\n\nA UN committee on finance tried to combine all these estimates and earlier this year put the number as high as $6.9tn.\n\nIt is unlikely a figure in that region will be announced at Baku. Developed nations including the UK, have recently raised concerns they may not meet their previous pledges because of ongoing domestic economic issues. \n\nAnother key area of discussion is how the money will be given - the majority of the public funding, 69%, is still given in the form of loans rather than direct grants. This can increase the debt burden in poorer nations.\n\nNafkote Dabi, Oxfam International Climate Policy lead, has called this \"profoundly unfair\".\n\nHe said: \"Instead of supporting countries that are facing worsening droughts, cyclones and flooding, rich countries are crippling their ability to cope with the next shock and deepening their poverty.\"\n\nThe third big question on the table is who will contribute. Thirty years ago, it was agreed that developed countries should take on more of the financial burden because of their historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and the economic benefits they enjoyed from exploiting fossil fuels.\n\nBut since then, developing nations like China have grown economically and have a larger carbon footprint.

{"doc_id": "article_096", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "These two institutions enslave climate-stricken nations with debt, making the consequences of any climate disaster that much worse.\nAs yet another United Nations Climate Change Conference fails to produce a strong commitment to urgent climate action, the climate crisis is on course to get much worse.\n\nWhile its effects, such as unprecedented flooding, devastating droughts, storm surges, biodiversity loss and more intense hurricanes appear novel in the eyes of many in the Global North, these disasters have caused immeasurable destruction for decades across the Global South, especially the Caribbean.\nExtreme weather events not only threaten the economic viability of these societies, but also call into question the role of the most powerful international economic institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIntervention by these bodies has consistently worsened the economic situation of climate-stricken communities. This is why the World Bank and the IMF need to be abolished to save the planet and human lives.\n\nCaribbean island nations know this reality all too well. On July 1, Hurricane Beryl slammed into Grenada. Two of its island territories, Carriacou and Petite Martinique, were flattened, as Beryl damaged or destroyed nearly 100 percent of homes and devastated infrastructure. At least six people were killed.\n\nThe neighbouring island nation of St Vincent and the Grenadines also suffered widespread destruction due to the hurricane. Across the two countries, as many as 80,000 people were affected, with 20,000 people made homeless and 11 killed.\nJamaica was not spared either. The hurricane killed at least four people and affected 160,000. Farming communities suffered devastating losses.\n\nIt has been now almost five months since the hurricane swept through the Caribbean and these communities are still struggling to recover. This is because these island nations have been taken hostage by disastrous deals with the IMF and the World Bank.\n\nInstead of helping a region that is at the epicentre of climate disasters, these two institutions force its nations into borrowing arrangements that prioritise austerity and objectives of global capital, rather than immediate and longer-term relief and recovery. As a result, communities suffer under increased public debt and reduced investment in supporting the social infrastructure necessary to respond to climate disasters and mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nIn addition, instead of offering unconditional relief and recovery funding on terms required to truly meet the needs of people, these entities have explicitly supported debt-related financial tools like catastrophe insurance or bonds, debt swaps, and now “disaster clauses” integrated into debt contracts. A disaster or hurricane clause adds to the contractual terms of a debt instrument the ability of a borrower to defer payments of interest and principal in the event of a qualifying natural disaster.\n\nThe clause sets out the kinds of preconditions for specific events or triggers that would permit the borrower to temporarily defer repayments of interest, principal, or both for a period of one to two years. This mechanism does not reduce or eliminate debt.\n\nWhile it purports to offer “relief”, it brings further misery and onerous costs to climate-devastated governments and communities. Take for example the disaster clause, which has been praised and advocated by Caribbean economist and current climate finance adviser of the Inter-American Development Bank, Avinash Persaud, one of the architects of the “Bridgetown Initiative” for the reform of the international financial system.\n\nIt can only be triggered when an arbitrary threshold like wind speed or financial cost of destruction during a hurricane has been satisfied or exceeded. In the case of Hurricane Beryl, Grenada was able to trigger this clause, but Jamaica was not able to make use of a similar financial tool. In Grenada’s case, the deferred payments will be added back to the principal in subsequent years.\n\nIn Jamaica’s case, a catastrophe bond could not be used because the hurricane did not meet the so-called “air pressure” parameter, which means investors’ funds remain safe. A catastrophe bond is a high-yield debt instrument arranged by the World Bank and designed to raise money for insurance corporations in the event of a natural disaster. These investors profit as much as 15 percent returns on these instruments when they fail to pay out. If a payout was triggered, bondholders could have paid as much as $150m.\nThese thresholds do not follow scientific evidence or consider the complicated nature and unpredictability of these disasters. That is because they are determined by financial analysts who pursue higher returns for investors.\n\nWithout sufficient resources for recovery and relief efforts, Jamaica and Grenada may be forced to request recovery loans from the IMF and the World Bank, therefore increasing debt burdens even further.\n\nThe long-term effect of these arrangements can be seen in Barbuda, Sint Maarten and Dominica, which were devastated by Category 5 Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. My recent visits to these islands, which have not fully recovered, show that debt-related financial instruments are not just wholly inadequate, but utterly unjust. They cannot ensure the social, economic and environmental recovery of communities.\n\nIn Dominica, for example, debt has mushroomed after the hurricane disaster as climate financing to help it “recover” came in the form of loans. As a result, the nation of 70,000 people is having to pay $30m per year just to service debt. As one Dominican taxi driver put it to me: “The true hurricane started after the hurricane passed.”\n\nThe hardship that the IMF and the World Bank heap on climate-devastated communities falls in line with the legacies and realities of colonialism. The logic of their mechanisms can be traced back to the insurance system, capital markets, and financial instruments that fuelled the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nDuring that time, enslaved Africans were viewed as chattel and nonhuman property, ships owned by enslavers were insured by major brokers, and slave-produced commodities received investment from colonial governments and financial corporations. These all aimed to accumulate the wealth that produced metropolitan Europe.\n\nThe World Bank and the IMF operate today as neocolonial institutions that continue the agenda of Euro-American imperial powers. They do not act to mitigate disasters but perpetuate them through debt bondage imposed on climate-devastated countries in the Caribbean and elsewhere.\n\nIn this moment of multiple, intersecting crises, they are unsuited for the perils and challenges of the climate crisis. To be sure, the World Bank and the IMF were not intended to serve “The Wretched of the Earth” to borrow Frantz Fanon’s language. They were created to prop up Euro-American supremacy and hegemony and protect the interests of global capital.\n\nWe therefore cannot expect these bodies to be reformed and operate against the economic and political interests of imperial powers and big capital. We need a global movement that calls for and acts on abolishing these institutions for us to meet the demands of these critical times. We need to do away with the World Bank and the IMF for the sake of human lives and for the sake of the planet.", "sentences": ["The article argues that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank worsen the impacts of climate disasters on Global South nations, particularly in the Caribbean, by trapping them in cycles of debt.", "Instead of providing meaningful recovery support, these institutions offer financial tools like catastrophe bonds and disaster clauses, which often fail to trigger payouts or merely defer payments, deepening debt burdens.", "Examples from Grenada, Jamaica, and Dominica illustrate how such mechanisms prioritize investor interests over community needs.", "The author links these practices to neocolonial structures rooted in the legacy of slavery and exploitation.", "The piece calls for a global movement to abolish the IMF and World Bank, arguing they are incompatible with the urgent demands of the climate crisis.", "True climate justice, the article concludes, requires dismantling these institutions to ensure equitable, effective support for vulnerable nations."]}

However, the trigger for the change is a worry for both: climate change, which has resulted in significant glacial melt since at least the 1970s.\n\nSo how are melting glaciers changing the Swiss-Italian border, where does the boundary between the two shift, and is Europe witnessing melting glaciers more generally?\nHow and why is the Swiss-Italian border shifting?\n\n“In the high mountains, significant sections of the Italian-Swiss border are determined by the watershed, represented by the crest line of glaciers, snowfields and perpetual snow,” the Swiss government explained in a statement on September 27. “However, with the melting of the glaciers, these natural elements evolve and redefine the national border when it is defined dynamically.”\n\nSimply put, the ridge that runs along the highest points on the glacier that sits on the Matterhorn serves as the natural border between Italy and Switzerland. It is determined as the line along which any glacial melt could fall on either side.\nAs the glacier has melted, the highest points – and so the ridge joining them – have moved a little further into Italian territory. In other words, the Swiss will gain a bit of territory under the new border agreement.\nIs this the only instance of melting glaciers shifting borders?\n\nNo. This is not just an issue between Italy and Switzerland. A new border agreement was signed between Italy and Austria in 2006.\n\nIn their book, A Moving Border: Alpine Cartographies of Climate Change, Marco Ferrari, Elisa Pasqual and Andrea Bagnato examined how melting glaciers and shifting watersheds are affecting the borders between Italy, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nExplaining their findings in a 2022 interview with Vox, Ferrari said many of the analysts responsible for mapping and surveying the border boundaries had noticed the glacier was melting and snow was not being replaced. The constant melting of the glacier would slowly affect the natural shape of the border.\nDoes the changed border affect anything?\n\nSwitzerland and neighbouring parts of Italy rely heavily on tourism linked to skiing and other Alpine sports for their economy. In fact, the economies of the bordering regions are often interlinked.\n\nSki resorts such as Zermatt in Switzerland attract hundreds of thousands of tourists every season, but access ski terrain which is shared with Italian resorts.\n\nMelting glaciers affect both. But maintaining glaciers and ensuring their health is the responsibility of the country where it lies – and clear boundaries are critical for Italy and Switzerland to know which part of each border glacier they are respectively responsible for.\nStill, even with a shifting border, the neighbours will need to collaborate. Avalanches, for instance, do not respect borders – they can begin in one country and end in another. This can complicate issues when it comes to footing the bill for damage or lost lives.\n\nIn April this year, three people were killed in an avalanche slide near Zermatt. Climate experts attributed the sudden avalanche to glacial melting caused by temperature fluctuations which have created weakened layers in the snow pack.\n\nOn July 3, 2022, 11 climbers lost their lives on the Marmolada summit, the highest mountain in the Dolomites, due to a rock and glacier fall. A chunk of the glacier collapsed, sending ice, rock, and snow onto the climbers.\nHow have European glaciers been affected by climate change?\n\nAccording to a recent report from the Swiss Academy of Sciences, Swiss glaciers lost 4 percent of their volume in 2023 with the largest decline at 6 percent in 2022. That is a 10 percent cumulative loss of their ice volume over the past two years with further losses anticipated in the foreseeable future.\n\nThat volume loss is the same as the amount of ice lost between 1960 and 1990. Some areas are experiencing an average ice melt of 3 metres (roughly 10 feet) over a period of two years from 2022 to 2023, recorded at altitudes above 3,200 metres (about 10,500 feet).\n\nAccording to the European State of the Climate 2023 study, compiled by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Europe is close to the Arctic whose polar regions are more susceptible to intense weather events. Furthermore, oceanic and atmospheric currents around Europe are warmer.\nAs glaciers further lose their ice and snow coverage, this reduces their capacity to reflect sunlight. This lowered “albedo effect” causes additional warming, which in turn speeds up the melting process. Consequently, a self-reinforcing cycle emerges, where the initial melting triggers further ice loss, perpetuating and intensifying the glacial decline.\nExtreme glacial melt has several knock-on effects besides avalanches.\n\nAs glaciers further lose their ice and snow coverage, this reduces their capacity to reflect sunlight. This lowered “albedo effect” causes additional warming, which in turn speeds up the melting process. Consequently, a self-reinforcing cycle emerges, where the initial melting triggers further ice loss, perpetuating and intensifying the glacial decline.\n\nThe 2023 report also states the following:\n    Year 2023 was the second-warmest on record for Europe, at 1.02–1.12C (1.8-2F) above average.\n    The three warmest years on record for Europe have all occurred since 2020, and the 10 warmest since 2007.\n    Temperatures in Europe were above average for 11 months of 2023 and September was the warmest on record.\n    Winter and autumn, 2023, were both the second-warmest on record.\n\nCan the melting of glaciers be reversed or stopped?\n\nAccording to the European Geosciences Union, glaciers will lose half their ice by 2050 even if the planet warms less than 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement, a landmark international treaty aimed at addressing climate change and adopted by 196 countries, agreed that limiting global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels should be the target to slow down further glacial melt and avoid the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change.\n\nMore innovative solutions to address melting glaciers in particular include Geotextiles – white fabric placed over areas of a glacier to reflect the sun away and insulate the glacier.\nThe Seabed Curtain project is a programme to build a massive curtain anchored to the seabed along the Antarctic coast that would restrict the flow of warm water to prevent further melting of glaciers there.\n\nAccording to the Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland in Finland, the cost of such a project could be $40bn to $80bn along with $1bn to $2bn annually in maintenance costs.", "sentences": ["Italy and Switzerland are redrawing their Alpine border near the Matterhorn due to glacial melting caused by climate change, which has shifted natural watershed boundaries used to define their border.", "As glaciers recede, the highest points that determine the ridge line have moved, effectively transferring a small amount of territory to Switzerland.", "This shift is part of a broader trend seen in other Alpine regions, such as Italy’s borders with Austria.", "The changing border has implications for tourism, environmental management, and safety responsibilities, especially as glacial melt increases risks like avalanches.", "Reports show that Swiss glaciers have lost 10% of their volume in just two years, with 2023 being Europe’s second-warmest year on record.", "Experts warn that glacier loss may be irreversible without drastic climate action, though innovative solutions like reflective geotextiles and seabed curtains are being explored to slow the melting process."]}

{"doc_id": "article_106", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Rising temperatures have led to a surge in demand for cooling. But, ironically, the more we rely on energy-intensive air conditioners, the more the planet warms. How can we do things differently? In many places, keeping cool when the mercury climbs isn't just a matter of comfort — sweltering temperatures can affect our health, our productivity, our economies and even our survival.\n\nAn increase of just 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels could put 2.3 billion people at risk of severe heat waves. Scientists have said we could hit that temperature rise by the early 2030s if we don't cut carbon emissions.\n\nHot weather is already responsible for some 12,000 deaths each year. By 2030, the World Health Organization has conservatively predicted there could be 38,000 additional deaths annually due to heat exposure in elderly people. \n\nBuying an air conditioner might be a quick and easy fix, but these energy-intensive appliances are only adding to the problem. Not only that: air conditioners can leak damaging refrigerants that can also contribute to global warming.\n\n\"We need to get out of this cycle,\" Lily Riahi from the United Nations Environment Program told DW. \"The way we currently cool our homes and workplaces is a huge driver of climate change.\"\nCooling conundrum \n\nIn 2024 — the hottest year on record — electricity demand surged to nearly double the growth rate of the last decade, according to the latest figures from the International Energy Agency. A spark of good news, however: the largest slice of that growth was supplied by renewable energy, at 38%.\n\nBut much of that electricity is still supplied by fossil fuels. The IEA said two-thirds of the world's electricity was provided by coal in 2024, with coal power growing by nearly 1%. A major contributor to growing electricity demand: air conditioning.\n\nThat finding was also confirmed in an analysis of the world's three largest power markets, India, China and the US, by energy think tank Ember. \"Extreme heat events drove air conditioner use to a record high, increasing electricity demand and putting pressure on grids,\" said the report, released in early March 2025. \n\nAs global temperatures, populations and incomes rise in countries like India and China, the number of AC units in operation worldwide could jump from more than 2.4 billion today to 5.6 billion by 2050, according to the IEA.\n\nThe agency also estimates that, without improvements to efficiency, energy demand for space cooling could triple by the middle of the century — consuming as much electricity as China and India today. \n\nRiahi, who is also a global coordinator for the Cool Coalition network working to boost sustainable cooling, said this scenario will pile massive pressure on electricity grids and ultimately hamper efforts to meet climate targets.\n\n\"By 2050, estimates say that just space cooling will account for 30% to 50% of peak electricity [load] in many countries. Today the average is 15%,\" said Riahi. \"So you're going to have grid failures.\"\nWhat can be done about it?\n\nAir conditioning plays an important role in prosperity and economic development by allowing people in hot countries to live and work in comfort. But unless ACs become significantly more climate-friendly, the projected explosion in their numbers will pose a huge challenge.\nRiahi said there's a lack of awareness around cooling alternatives, as well as financial barriers that prevent people purchasing energy-efficient ACs with low-emission refrigerants. \n\n\"AC doesn't have to mean the cheapest air conditioning on the market,\" she said. \"It should be about how can we design our cities and buildings to reduce the demand for cooling in the first place. And it can also mean finding ways to create incentives to bring the most efficient technologies to market.\"\nCooling roofs in informal settlements\n\nSurviving higher temperatures while at the same time keeping a lid on emissions will require more than improving AC efficiency. Fitting buildings with exterior shading, green roofs or applying solar reflective paint, for instance, can also limit the heat they absorb. Expanding green spaces, areas with water and wind corridors in cities could help, too.\n\nIn India, the Mahila Housing Trust is working with people in slum communities who cannot afford ACs to help them keep their homes cool. The organization focuses on low-cost measures such as painting heat-trapping corrugated tin roofs white, planting trees near homes to provide shade or installing roofs made of compressed bamboo mats, which absorb less heat.\nTrust director Bijal Brahmbhatt said just coating roofs in solar reflective paint can make indoor temperatures drop by up to 6 Celsius — a change residents reported was almost like having an AC. \n\n\"The well-being level has increased quite a lot,\" she said. \"Economic productivity increased by 1 1/2 to 2 hours once the temperature got reduced.\" People were also able to slash their power bills because they no longer had to use fans, she added.\nLessons from the desert \n\nAnother project, this time in the Egyptian desert where summer temperatures can reach almost 50 C, is also tackling heat solely through smart building design. \n\nArchitect Sarah El-Battouty, founder of green building firm ECOnsult, said they'd managed to reduce building temperatures by around 10 C without mechanical solutions.\nHer company has worked with the Egyptian government to upgrade 4,000 rural villages, home to some 58 million people, so that they can better cope with extreme heat. But rather than bringing in high-tech solutions, El-Battouty said many of the green changes were inspired by local Indigenous knowledge.\n\n\"These villages have survived. It's because this inherent knowledge of adaptation to harsh conditions has existed for thousands of years,\" she said. \"We see which of these solutions are viable and we integrate them […] We don't need to reinvent the wheel.\"\n\nThat means using locally available materials like porous limestone and sandstone that allow air to flow through the walls. They also lifted structures slightly off the ground to prevent heat being absorbed from below, added darkened entryways, installed reflective roofs and made use of angled windows and adjustable shading to block heat while allowing light to enter.\n'Cooling is the next frontier' \n\nEl-Battouty said there needs to be a rethink in the architecture sector so that buildings are designed to address cooling from the start. \n\n\"The hotter it gets, the longer the summers, the more people will be looking at solutions like air conditioning,\" she said. \"We have to question the housing sector itself. Is it built to mitigate heat or not?\"\n\nThe role of housing in beating heat should also have a much bigger focus at events like the annual UN climate change conference, added El-Battouty. \n\n\"We have to look at cooling as something incredibly important — just as much as renewable and clean energy. Cooling is the next frontier.\"", "sentences": ["As global temperatures rise, reliance on air conditioning is increasing, but these energy-intensive systems are exacerbating climate change.", "Experts warn that without improvements in cooling efficiency and alternatives, energy demand could triple by 2050, straining electricity grids and hindering climate targets.", "Initiatives like India's Mahila Housing Trust promote low-cost cooling methods such as reflective paint and bamboo roofing to reduce heat without ACs.", "In Egypt, architect Sarah El-Battouty uses Indigenous knowledge to design cooler buildings with passive features like limestone walls and reflective roofs.", "Both examples highlight the need for sustainable, climate-adaptive architecture to reduce reliance on ACs.", "Experts emphasize that cooling must be prioritized in climate discussions as a critical component of resilient infrastructure."]}

When President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office in early 2023, environmentalists breathed a sigh of relief. After four years of environmental destruction under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, the new leader arrived on a pledge to protect the climate.\n\nFast forward two years, and that relief has turned to disappointment. Just months before Brazil is due to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), Lula is pushing for oil exploration at the mouth of the Amazon River, and his government has approved joining the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+).\n\n\"The world has given Brazil a mandate to lead the climate debate in 2025,\" said Claudio Angelo, coordinator of communications at Brazilian nonprofit Observatorio do Clima. \"To double down on oil expansion is a betrayal of that mandate.\" \nIs Brazil doubling down on its oil industry?\n\nBrazil has vast reserves of oil and ranks as the eighth-largest global exporter — behind such countries as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. But the government is looking to increase its oil share and move up into fourth place.\n\n\"We should not be ashamed of being oil producers,\" said Brazil's energy minister, Alexandre Silveira, upon announcing the country's plans to join OPEC+. \"Brazil needs to grow, develop and create income and jobs.\" \n\nOPEC brings together major oil-producing countries, including Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, to coordinate the production of oil and maintain a stable market. Other significant producers, the largest of which is Russia, are not full members, but agree to cooperate with nations as part of OPEC+.\n\nSpeaking to reporters during a recent press briefing, Andre Correa do Lago, president-designate of the upcoming COP30 climate summit, said joining OPEC+ gives Brazil the chance to be involved in conversations on transitioning away from oil. \n\nThough Brazil will not be a full member of OPEC, environmentalists have criticized the move, arguing that it cements the country's oil ambitions for the future.\n\nLula has argued, however, that oil revenues are needed to help finance a green energy transition. Correa do Lago reiterated this line, saying it is easier and cheaper to borrow money to invest in oil projects than in other more sustainable ones.\n\nThe money \"you gain from exploring oil can be used internally for projects that are good for the [clean energy] transition,\" he said.\nIs Brazil embracing renewables?\n\nIlan Zugman, Latin American managing director of environmental campaign organization 350.org, rejects the government's argument. He says there is currently no national policy for a further move to renewables and that even if there were, money for such a transition could be funneled from other sources.\n\n\"Brazil every year gives billions and billions of dollars to subsidize the fossil fuel industry...we'd like to see Brazil shifting some of these subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables,\" he told DW.\n\nAccording to a report from the nonprofit scientific and technological institution INESC P&D Brazil, federal subsidies for the production and consumption of oil, gas and coal reached around $14.56 billion (€13.3 billion) in 2022. That's five times more than is invested in renewables.\n\n\"The money is there; it is just not being put in the right places,\" said Zugman. \"And of course, we're still missing the political will, the courage to make some bold decisions and start shifting these resources to an energy that can improve our situation of carbon emissions in the world.\"\nIs President Lula really a climate leader?\n\nBrazil is the world's sixth biggest greenhouse gas emitter, with deforestation and changing land use within the Amazon region accounting for a majority of the country's emissions. The Amazon is the world's largest tropical rainforest and a significant carbon sink. \nFollowing his 2022 electoral victory, Lula promised to rein in the illegal logging, mining and land clearing for activities like cattle ranches and soybean farms that had become commonplace under his predecessor.\n\nIn the first six months of Lula's tenure, deforestation fell by around a third and has continued to decrease. The president pledged to end tree felling in the Amazon by the end of the decade. \nThe country's bid to host the COP30 summit in the Amazon city of Belem was seen as further evidence of the government's commitment to climate. So too, Brazil's timely submission of its latest climate goals, which are required by signatories of the Paris climate accord. The agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).\n\nBrazil's targets promise an emissions cut of between 59% and 67% over 2005 levels by 2035. \n\n\"That's frankly not that ambitious,\" Angelo of Observatorio do Clima said. \"It's nowhere near compatible with 1.5 [degrees].\"\n\nThe goals also do not include any targets on oil exports, the burning of which doesn't count towards Brazil's emissions, but will have an impact globally.\n\nResearchers from SEEG, a major greenhouse gas monitoring platform in Latin America, say that if Brazil were to exploit projected reserves, the emissions from their burning would cancel out the savings made through reducing Amazon deforestation.\nThe impacts of climate change are felt in Brazil\n\nBrazil is facing some of the most devastating consequences of climate change. In the last year alone, the country experienced its worst drought on record and wildfires ravaged an area of around 30.86 million hectares in 2024, an area larger than Italy.\n\nWorld Weather Attribution, a collective of scientists investigating the connection between extreme weather and global heating, found human-driven climate change made wildfires that burned through the Pantanal wetland in June 2024 at least four times more likely and 40% more intense. \n\n\"People [in Brazil] are literally feeling the heat,\" said Angelo. \"This is not lost to the presidency.

They include coronary heart disease — the nation's single biggest killer — atrial fibrillation, heart attacks, congenital heart disease, heart failure and stroke.\n\nHigh blood pressure, high cholesterol, inactivity, poor nutrition, smoking and stress are well known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, but the study highlights how exposure to heat has been overlooked.\n\n\"The burden of disease for cardiovascular disease due to hot weather in the context of climate change might double [in the next 25 years],\" said the study's lead author Peng Bi, a public health expert at the University of Adelaide, Australia.\n\nThe study contributes to a growing body of evidence that heat caused by human-made climate change is a growing health concern.\n\n\"[This] is a quite alarming call to our community, to our service providers and to our policymakers,\" Bi told DW.\nHeat burden leads to unhealthy hearts\n\nThe study analyzed health data from the Australian population between 2003-2018. The study is the first to find that high temperatures have a major impact on cardiovascular health.\n\nThe analysis found that Australia's population lost almost 50,000 years of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from heat-related cardiovascular diseases annually during that period.\n\nDALYs measure the overall burden of a disease in a population. It is a calculation of the years of \"healthy” life lost because of a disease, either from living with a disability or by dying prematurely.\n\nThe study found that people living in hotter parts of Australia in the Northern Territory are at greatest risk of heat-related cardiovascular disease burden.\n\nModelling undertaken by the research group also found that heat-related heart diseases are expected to more than double as global temperatures continue to rise.\nHeat adaptation will be critical for vulnerable groups\n\nBi said that his findings mean authorities need to consider new measures to protect vulnerable populations from heat-related health issues.\n\n\"People with chronic diseases, older people, people with low socioeconomic status — they are at high risk,\" Bi said.\n\nThis includes \"check-ins\" with vulnerable groups. Following a severe heatwave in 2009, Bi worked with local authorities to introduce a telephone check-up system.\n\n\"During the hot days, university volunteer students sitting in the Red Cross made a phone call to senior citizens twice a day to check whether they were OK. If yes, that's fine, otherwise we had some follow-up mechanism actions,\" Bi said.\n\nOther measures include educating behavioral changes to adapt to heat.

But rolling back green policies threatens clean energy jobs, future growth and resilience to extreme weather.\nOn Donald Trump's first day back in the White House on January 20, he signed several related executive orders that sparked radical climate policy and clean energy rollbacks.  \n\nOne order declared a \"national energy emergency.\" Another, titled \"unleashing American energy,\" blamed \"burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations\" for limiting \"reliable and affordable electricity\" created primarily from oil, gas and coal.  \n\nAs promised, Trump also targeted wind energy with an order that temporarily pauses all offshore permits and federal leases.  \n\nOil and gas production in the US, the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, actually peaked under the Joe Biden administration. Average electricity prices across nearly all US states were also lower and more stable in 2024 than the previous year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.  \nThis was not only because of low natural gas prices but more cheaper renewable energy in the grid and new battery storage capacity, due in part to decreasing renewable technology costs.  \n\nTrump's order also attacked green energy transition policies for limiting \"job creation,\" despite the US renewable energy sector employing around three times more workers than the traditional fossil energy industry.  \n\nJob growth in the clean power sector rose at more than twice the rate of the \"strong\" overall US labor market in 2023.   \n\nThe year before, renewable energy technologies, including solar panels, wind turbines, hydropower and geothermal energy systems, already made up over 84% of net new electricity generation jobs.  \nA dagger through the heart of climate-change religion'  \n\nThis month, the new head of the Environment Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, announced 31 regulatory and funding rollbacks related to climate and environment protection, and clean energy funding.  \n\n\"We are living up to our promises to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry,\" Zeldin said in a video posted on social media platform, X. \"We are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion,\" he added.\n\nIn addition, he announced the termination of $20 billion (€18.3 billion) worth of clean power and climate grants issued by the outgoing Biden administration under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, also known as the \"green bank.\"  \n\nZeldin highlighted \"programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse\" when announcing that the EPA had frozen the funding pending a review.\n\nBut on Tuesday, a US federal judge said the EPA's \"vague and unsubstantiated assertions of fraud are insufficient.\"  \n\nOn these grounds, the judge blocked the agency from terminating $14 billion dollars in green grants earmarked for three climate groups who had sued the EPA and Zeldin.\nPaying for massive climate damages  \n\nWhen Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement earlier this year, he sparked fears that the country's failure to reduce emissions could severely hinder efforts to limit global heating.\n\nThis would also result in major costs for citizens in the US and beyond. A report by business advisors, the Boston Consulting Group predicts that if temperatures increase by 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 Fahrenheit) by 2100 — double the 1.5-degree target set in Paris — such warming would \"reduce cumulative economic output by 15% to 34%\" by the end of the century.\n\nIn the last decade alone, climate-related extreme weather events have cost the global economy more than $2 trillion, according to a recent report by the International Chamber of Commerce. \n\nThe January Los Angeles wildfires that caused widespread destruction and have been linked to human-made climate change alone caused property and capital damages of up to $164 billion. \n\nBoston Consulting note that the net cost of inaction could be as high as 27% of cumulative GDP globally, which is enough to otherwise eradicate extreme poverty around the world. \nClimate rollbacks to spark job losses and economic decline  \n\nCorey Bradshaw, a professor of global ecology at Flinders University in South Australia, says the Trump administration claims that its climate cuts will improve economic prosperity are false. Disincentivizing the green manufacturing boom will only result in job losses and economic decline for American consumers, he said.  \n\n\"Their cost of living will grow and their income opportunities will decline,\" he told DW.  \n\nTwo years after the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) triggered the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy technologies, the sector has accounted for more than half of the total US private investment growth, according to a 2024 report by the Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) — which tracks public and private funding of climate technologies in the US.  \n\nThe fastest growth was in manufacturing clean energy and transportation technology, which totalled $89 billion in the two years after the IRA was legislated — more than four times the $22 billion invested in the two years prior to the Biden administration's flagship 2022 law to address climate change.  \n\nRepublican states have been significant beneficiaries of this clean energy largesse. Nearly 60% of the projects announced since 2022 are in the party's congressional districts.  \n\nGeorgia alone gained over 43,000 green jobs and more than $30 billion in renewables investment since the passage of the IRA. More than 400,000 new clean energy jobs were created nationally.\n\nBy 2024, the US power grid had added more capacity from solar energy than from any other source in more than two decades.  \n\nSylvia Levya Martinez, a solar analyst for US energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, which co-authored a report announcing the record solar uptake, warned that the boom could be quickly reversed, however.  \n\n\"Last year's record-level of installations was aided by several solar policies and credits within the Inflation Reduction Act that helped drive interest in the solar market,\" she said in a statement. \"If many of these policies were eliminated or significantly altered, it would be very detrimental to the industry's continued growth.\"  \nTrump's climate revolt to be held up in the courts?\n\nMeanwhile, David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, a pro-climate non-profit, believes that efforts to dismantle climate and environmental protection will be delayed in the courts.  \n\n\"The EPA cannot roll those regulations back without a lengthy process,\" he said, noting that during the first Trump administration, the EPA lost most of its anti-climate court cases due to failure to follow procedural rules.  \n\nCorey Bradshaw cautions, however, that while Trump's attempted climate rollbacks are \"illogical\" and amount to support for \"a dying fossil fuel industry,\" any delay to urgent emission cuts will quickly \"retard any climate gains.\"", "sentences": ["Donald Trump's return to the presidency has triggered major rollbacks of U.", "S.", "climate policies, including freezing clean energy grants, pausing offshore wind projects, and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.", "His administration argues these changes will boost economic growth, but critics warn they threaten clean energy jobs, investment, and progress on emissions reductions.", "Despite renewable energy outperforming fossil fuels in job creation and grid contributions, the EPA under Lee Zeldin is dismantling key initiatives, with some actions already challenged and halted in court.", "Economists warn that climate inaction could slash global GDP by up to 34% by 2100, with extreme weather already costing trillions.", "Clean energy sectors, especially in Republican states, had seen massive job growth and investment following the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.", "Experts caution that undermining these gains for fossil fuel expansion risks reversing environmental and economic progress."]}

{"doc_id": "article_111", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "The US government has scrapped paper straws to go back to plastic. So why are the plastic variety restricted in many countries around the world in the first place? When US President Donald Trump vowed to end the \"ridiculous situation\" of paper straws with an executive order recently, he noted that he had used \"them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode.\" The order rolled back a previous policy aiming to phase out single-use plastic items, including straws, in federal operations such as food service, and directed the government to stop buying paper versions. Many people will have encountered a soggy paper straw that flops after a few sips. It's a frustrating experience for sure, but some are concerned Trump's targeting of them could be a signal of a broader move \"back to plastic.\" The US president is using the item's poor design \"as a representation or a token\" to suggest being environmentally friendly is inconvenient for us, said Randa Kachef, urban waste and sustainability expert and research affiliate at King's College London in the UK. What's the problem with plastic products like straws? Just over a decade ago, it was not the image of exploding paper ones that came to mind at the mention of straws, but one of animal suffering. In 2015, the video of a plastic straw being painfully removed from a turtle's bleeding nostril went viral, spurring a movement to reduce plastic waste. Since then, plastic straws have become emblematic of the global plastic pollution problem that now touches every part of life on Earth. Annually, humans produce an estimated 380 million tons of plastic waste, including 43 million tons of single-use items, such as straws. A lot of that ends up polluting the environment. According to one estimate, over 8 billion plastic straws litter the world's coastlines. Plastic can take hundreds of years to break down but never fully decomposes. Tiny particles have been found in water, soil, air, the food chain and even in our bodies. An increasing number of studies have suggested plastic is linked to serious health issues like decreased reproductive capacity and cancer. While estimates suggest plastic straws make up less than 1% of the weight of ocean plastic waste, their lightness and size mean they are quicker to fragment and harder to collect than bigger plastic items, said Kachef. They have also offered a tangible entry point to tackling the huge challenge that is the plastic crisis, she added. For example, in recent years, environmental concerns have driven several US cities and states, brands such as McDonalds and Starbucks, as well as the UK, EU, Canada and India to restrict plastic straw use as part of wider clamp downs on single-use plastic. How good are the alternatives to plastic straws? Growing awareness of plastic straws' harmful impact has led to a surge in eco-alternatives made from materials such as metal, glass, bamboo, and, of course, paper. When it comes to the paper versions, Donald Trump isn't their only critic. \"Nobody likes paper straws,\" said Kachef. \"The design of the straw was not the best. I'll admit to that.\" On the other hand, most have barely noticed the replacement of plastic items such as cotton buds or coffee stirrers with other materials, she added. Still, many of the alternatives also have their own environmental drawbacks. Paper straws, for example, are often coated in plastic to keep them water resistant. Some studies have suggested they contain higher levels of PFAS — chemicals that contaminate water and have been linked to a range of health issues — than plastic. According to one study, when it comes to emissions involved in producing a straw, paper versions were better than plastic. However, reusable options, such as glass and stainless-steel, involve energy intensive production processes. They would have to be used 23-39 and 37-63 times respectively to \"break even\" with the emissions of disposable alternatives, found the study. While no alternative is perfect, single-use plastic is still the worst option, said Kachef, adding the type of plastic they are usually made from — polypropylene — mostly can't be recycled.  \"Every straw we've ever used still exists, either in landfill or in the environment— unless it has been incinerated which has other implications of air pollution,\" said Kachef. Kachef said plastic itself is really important in a medical environment to prevent cross-contamination and that straws are essential for people with certain medical conditions or disabilities. But a wider move back to plastic straws would unequivocally be a backwards step for the environment and climate, added Kachef. \"A single metal steel straw might have an environmental impact that is greater than a single plastic straw ... but I think if someone uses that for the rest of their life, that's not a problem,\" said Kachef. \"The issue is not to treat alternatives or 'for life' products as disposable.\" What impact could the executive order on straws have? Practically speaking, Donald Trump's executive order means places like US government buildings and properties, including national parks, will now offer plastic rather than paper straws, said Rachel Radvany, environmental health campaigner at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL). It's a move that would see \"an increase in completely preventable plastic waste,\" she said. But it's one the plastics industry is celebrating. \"Straws are just the beginning — 'Back to Plastic' is a movement we should all get behind,\" said Matt Seaholm, CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, in a statement following the executive order. Radvany added that straws are just one tiny part of the plastic crisis but have \"become a flash point in culture wars\" that distract from a wider issue, namely \"the fact that plastics are fossil fuels in another form.\" Some 99% of plastic is made from chemicals derived from fossil fuels. The rapidly expanding, multibillion-dollar industry is the fastest growing source of industrial emissions. By 2040, it could account for 19% of the greenhouse gases responsible for heating up the planet and fueling extreme weather. As the world transitions away from oil and gas, some see plastics as an alternative business model for the fossil fuel industry. It's important to pay close attention to the plastic straw executive order, said Radvany, \"to ensure it does not become a pro-plastic Trojan Horse, leading to broader policies and guidance that will favor sustained or even increased production of plastics.\"", "sentences": ["The U.", "S.", "government, under a recent executive order by Donald Trump, reversed its phase-out of plastic straws, citing paper alternatives as inconvenient and ineffective.", "This decision has sparked concerns among environmentalists who see it as symbolic of a broader rollback on plastic reduction efforts.", "Plastic straws, though a small part of the overall plastic crisis, have become emblematic due to their visibility and impact on wildlife, prompting bans in multiple countries.", "Alternatives like paper, metal, and glass have their own drawbacks, including environmental costs and chemical concerns, but are still seen as better than single-use plastic.", "Critics argue that returning to plastic straws could signal support for the fossil fuel-based plastic industry, which is a growing source of greenhouse gas emissions.", "Experts warn that the issue of plastic waste is much bigger than straws, and policies like this risk undermining global progress in combating plastic pollution."]}

But oil and gas interests could scupper a deal. Following two years of talks, countries are scrambling to finalize a binding global treaty that would limit the surge of plastics polluting the planet. Representatives from some 175 countries will try to overcome stark differences on how to tackle the waste deluge in the final round of negotiations this week in Busan, South Korea. The UN Environment Program (UNEP) has said a treaty would be the most significant multilateral environment deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord, given the huge scale of the plastic crisis. \"It is an insurance policy for this generation and future ones, so they may live with plastic and not be doomed by it,\" said Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director, in 2022, when nations first agreed to forge a treaty to end plastic pollution. In 2019, the world generated around 350 million tons of plastic waste. Just 9% was recycled, with the rest being incinerated, going to landfill or ending up in the environment. Once discarded, durable plastic products, such as single-use drinking straws, can remain in the environment for hundreds of years and contaminate ecosystems and the food chain. With some 99% of plastics sourced from fossil fuels, plastic production is also exacerbating the climate crisis, say scientists. Reducing plastic production the key challenge Environmental campaigners are calling on countries to consider reducing plastic polymer production globally by 40% by 2040 — a proposal put forward by Rwanda and Peru during the last round of talks in Ottawa, Canada, in April. This could happen through various mitigation measures used across the plastic life cycle. These include a reduction in plastic production; the elimination of toxic and avoidable single-use plastics; and the redesign of packaging to make it more reusable, biodegradable and fully recyclable. Multinational companies that use plastic packaging for their products are promoting more plastic recycling as a solution to the crisis, including through more efficient chemical recycling technologies as opposed to mechanical methods. But groups such as environment campaigners Greenpeace are calling for the treaty to focus on rapidly reducing plastic production. Production is set to triple by 2050, partly because making virgin plastic is cheaper than recycling — especially with an oversupply of fracked gas in countries like the US. The fossil fuel industry is also rapidly expanding virgin plastics as their next major growth market to replace business lost to the green energy transition. Recycling and waste management cannot keep pace with the explosion in production. \"Waste management capacity is overwhelmed; we have an oversupply and abundance of plastic,\" said Christina Dixon, Ocean Campaign leader at the New York-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), which is promoting the treaty. Will a plastics treaty be ambitious enough? But some say even a \"40x40\" goal is insufficient, especially amid efforts to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) in comparison with preindustrial times, a target agreed as part of the Paris climate accord to avoid ever more extreme impacts from global heating. By 2050, emissions from expanding production could consume at least 21-31% of the remaining carbon budget to stay within 1.5C. Modeling suggests a 75% cut in plastic production by 2040 is necessary to stay under the threshold, according to Greenpeace. Meanwhile, a report released by environmental scientists at Eunomia Research and Consulting and commissioned by the EIA says the 40x40 goal would work to significantly cut emissions only if coupled with a rise in global recycling rates to 63%, and that it wouldn't be enough for 1.5C. The report also stated that the plastic sector would need to decarbonize, using renewable energy, for example, while production would have to peak in 2025 at the same time. But as the final negotiation deadline approaches, countries are still at odds over how far the rules should go. Oil-producing nations oppose plastic production limits Many nations that will decide the scope and ambition of the plastics treaty have interests that clash with such rules. Led by Rwanda and Norway, more than 60 countries have joined a High Ambition Coalition that wants to end all plastic production by 2040. But according to EIA's Christina Dixon, several countries have been \"very difficult\" during the four rounds of negotiations so far and \"don't want to see any agreement at all.\" Oil-producing nations like Iran, Russia and Saudi Arabia are focused on increased recycling and not on plastic production cuts, wanting instead to preserve a vital fossil fuel market into the future. Daniela Duran Gonzalez, a senior legal campaigner with the Washington DC-based Center for International Environmental Law, said during the last round of treaty talks that negotiations were not over a \"waste treaty\" but \"the future of fossil fuels.\" The US, a plastics and fossil-fuel giant, changed tack following the last treaty negotiations and now supports a plastic reduction target. The fossil-fuel-rich nation had favored better plastics recycling and reuse, and voluntary compliance as opposed to binding production limits. That stance could change again with the incoming Donald Trump administration. The president-elect has long promised to roll back climate policies and expand fossil fuel production. \"Given what happened under the previous Trump administration, I think it's quite unlikely that Trump would ratify the treaty,\" said Dixon. But nations in the Global South, along with EU member states, are keeping the dream of a plastics treaty alive. Griffins Ochieng, programs coordinator at the Kenya-based Center for Environment Justice and Development, told a briefing held before the final treaty negotiations that African nations are demanding \"an end to plastics pollution across their whole life cycle.\" Reduction in plastic production will be key, along with the \"elimination\" of harmful chemicals, he said. While it is possible a treaty text will not be agreed in Busan, Dixon insists that negotiators should reflect a \"huge global appetite for a binding treaty.\"", "sentences": ["Countries are meeting in South Korea to finalize a global treaty aimed at curbing plastic pollution, seen as one of the most significant environmental agreements since the Paris climate accord.", "The treaty faces challenges from oil-producing nations and the fossil fuel industry, which oppose limits on plastic production and prefer recycling-focused solutions.", "Environmental advocates stress that reducing plastic production is essential to tackling both pollution and climate change, with proposals like a 40% cut by 2040.", "Some experts argue that even this target is insufficient, calling for a 75% cut to stay within the 1.", "5°C global warming limit.", "The final agreement is uncertain, especially with political shifts like a potential Trump presidency, but many countries and global South nations continue to push for ambitious action.", "The outcome will shape not only plastic pollution policy but potentially the future direction of fossil fuel reliance."]}

However, spiritual leaders in India used the festival to champion environmental sustainability. Nearly one-third of India's 1.4 billion plus population descended on the Maha Kumbh Mela, a six-week Hindu gathering held in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The number of people attending exceeded all expectations, according to the state government. \"The largest human religious festival in the world has already seen over 520 million arrive, averaging over 10 million every day,\" said Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, who oversaw earlier Kumbh preparations. However, an event of this magnitude presents serious environmental challenges. The influx of millions of Hindu pilgrims strains local water resources and ecosystems, generates vast quantities of trash, including non-biodegradable materials, and increases pollution levels. River pollution during Maha Kumbh Mela Concerns remain over the Ganges River's water quality and waste management during the 45-day spiritual and cultural festival. India's Central Pollution Control Board earlier this month reported high levels of fecal coliform at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers at Prayagraj, indicating sewage contamination. \"We need to protect nature as otherwise there may not be any Ganga or Yamuna left by the time the next Kumbh happens,\" Swami Mukundananda, a spiritual leader of the Jagadguru Kripalu Yog Trust, which promotes societal development, told DW. \"That is why we are reaching out to people to promote thought and awareness of waste, sanitation, environment, and hygiene management.\" Religious leaders promote climate action Saints, spiritual and religious leaders have come together for the first time at the Kumbh to highlight how religious institutions can address the climate crisis and environmental issues. Chief Secretary Singh pointed out that faith-based organizations are trying to promote sustainable practices driven by their core values and a sense of responsibility towards environmental stewardship. The Faith for Earth Initiative, launched by the UN Environment Program (UNEP) in 2017, strategically engages faith-based organizations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 agenda. Similarly, Ethiopia's Orthodox Tewahedo Church has helped preserve forests for centuries, protecting biodiversity. \"We are also trying to reconnect people with nature with the help of religious leaders. This is a beginning and more needs to be done,\" Singh said. Chidanand Saraswati, president of the Parmarth Niketan Ashram, based in the northern Indian city of Rishikesh, told DW that spiritual leaders can promote devotion and responsibility toward nature by bridging ancient wisdom with modern sustainability. \"If faith leaders, society and the government can join hands, we can find a solution,\" he added. Many believe religious leaders can be powerful advocates for climate action within their communities through education and faith-based activism. India's climate crisis intensifies Human-induced climate change is already exacerbating extreme weather in India, including heat waves, flooding and other disasters. Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, said these events threaten food, water, and energy security. \"The entire region, not just India, is witnessing a clear trend in rising heat waves, floods, landslides, droughts, and cyclones,\" Koll told DW. Chandra Bhushan, president and CEO of the International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iFOREST), an independent research and innovation organization, said the scientific community and government officials realize their limited reach. \"Providing scientific information is not enough to reach people. They understand climate change and its effects if they can relate it to their lives, which science and government programs cannot do,\" Bhushan told DW. He added that religious leaders can help bridge this gap, engaging communities on a spiritual and ethical level \"to promote sustainable practices and advocate for policy changes.\" In its 2022 report, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) painted a bleak picture for India, warning that it could face multiple climate change-induced disasters in the next two decades. Religious leaders have committed to promoting eco-friendly practices among their followers. This includes adopting renewable energy, implementing waste management strategies, and enhancing climate education programs within faith communities. \"We have made efforts to spread the word.

The world's warmest January on record continues a streak of extreme global temperatures, despite a shift toward a cooling La Nina weather pattern, Europe's climate monitor Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Thursday. January was 1.75 degrees Celsius (3.15 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than pre-industrial times and comes after historic temperature highs in 2023 and 2024, the scientists found. Their Global Climate Highlights report published last month confirmed that 2024 was the hottest year on record. The study revealed a rise of 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.9 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times — defined as the level between 1850 and 1900. Previously, 2023 was the warmest year. At the international climate conference in Paris in 2015, 196 world leaders agreed to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and to pursue efforts to keep temperatures below 1.5 degrees (2.7 Fahrenheit). Samantha Burgess, C3S's deputy director, told DW that the world is now \"teetering on the edge of passing the 1.5-degree level.\" She added that though the average of the last two years had already surpassed the threshold, it did not imply the Paris Agreement was broken, as the agreement is based on a mean calculated over decades and not individual years. But \"it shows the trajectory we are on,\" she said, warning of the impacts. \"We know from our understanding of the climate system that the warmer the atmosphere is, the more likely we are to have these hazardous extreme weather events and that's what really impacts people and ecosystems,\" she said. How have rising temperatures affected weather? So far, global average temperature rise — as measured over decades — has reached 1.3 Celsius, an increase that has already seen devastating consequences. In 2024, wildfires scorched parts of the Pantanal wetlands in Brazil and affected several countries in the region, while parts of Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and Spain were hit by heavy flooding. Heat waves struck in Europe and West Africa, and tropical storms swept across parts of the United States and Philippines. Scientists working as part of World Weather Attribution, an organization that studies the links between extreme weather and climate change, found that 26 of the events they looked at last year were made worse or more likely to happen due to rising temperatures. Human burning of fossil fuels for activities such as heating, industry and transportation is the main driver of global warming. But natural phenomena like El Nino have also played a part in pushing up temperatures over the past two years, said scientists at C3S. Warming oceans raising temperatures in 2025 Typically occurring every two to seven years, El Nino is associated with the warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, leading to overall average sea surface temperatures that are 0.51 degrees Celsius higher than the 1991–2020 average. Sea surface temperatures are of particular concern to scientists, because oceans store around 90% of the heat connected to global warming. \"It has acted as a buffer over the past half century, or 70 years, for us. We are exceeding that buffer capacity, and we are feeling that in terms of extreme events on land,\" said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of scientific excellence at the Union of Concerned Scientists nonprofit, who was not involved in collating the C3S data. Although the El Nino phase ended in 2024, Burgess said the ocean is holding onto more heat than in previous cycles which could affect heat levels in the coming year. \"Until we see that effectively dissipate into the deep ocean, we're likely to continue to see very high temperatures, but maybe not record-breaking temperatures,\" she said. Climate change a 'problem we need to talk about now' Despite growing alarm over rising global temperatures, levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere continue to grow. C3S reported that the rate of increase of carbon dioxide was higher than that observed in recent years. The gas, which remains in the atmosphere for 300 to 1,000 years, is most associated with rising temperatures. John Noel, a senior climate campaigner at environmental NGO Greenpeace in the US, blamed the \"grim milestone\" of the hottest recorded year on \"deliberate obstruction\" by fossil fuel executives and political allies. \"We must dismantle the dangerous corporate delusion that fossil fuel expansion can continue without consequence. Instead, we must embrace the once in a lifetime opportunity to build the zero-carbon infrastructure needed for a safe future that includes everyone,\" he said in a press statement. Meanwhile, Burgess told DW that without immediate action it was unlikely long-term average temperatures could be kept under the 1.5-degree limit. But she added that the world should not abandon those targets, as every fraction of a degree matters. \"[Climate change] is not a future problem that we have to deal with or that future generations will have to deal with, it's a problem that we need to talk about now,\" she said. \"We need to make sure that whoever we vote for is taking action on issues that are important to us, to make sure we can mitigate future climate change and adapt to our existing climate,\" she added.", "sentences": ["January 2024 was the hottest ever recorded, with global temperatures 1.", "75°C above pre-industrial levels, despite the expected cooling effects of La Niña.", "Scientists warn this continues a trend of extreme heat, pushing the planet dangerously close to surpassing the 1.", "5°C warming threshold set by the Paris Agreement.", "The rise in temperature has intensified natural disasters like wildfires, floods, and heatwaves across multiple regions.", "Ocean temperatures remain high due to past El Niño events, further driving global warming.", "Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, are the main contributors to this warming, with emissions still rising.", "Experts emphasize urgent climate action is needed now to prevent more severe impacts, as even small temperature increases can have major consequences for ecosystems and societies."]}

Fossil fuels are seeing record-breaking profits and trillions in investment but expansion plans are tipping the planet into dangerous heating. \nLast December, as the world witnessed a year of record-breaking emissions and global temperatures driven by the burning of fossil fuels, leaders agreed to \"transition away\" from coal, oil and gas.\n\nThe agreement, which was struck at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, heralded the \"beginning of the end\" of the fossil fuel era. \n\nBut as heads of state and government meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for this year's COP29 summit, trillions of dollars are still flowing into fossil fuel development.\n\nResearch from think tank Carbon Tracker shows that while some big oil and gas companies are planning production to peak or decline in the long term, there's a general trend toward increasing it in the short term. \n\nSo, what's driving this expansion, and what impact will it have on the climate? \nFossil fuel expansion is widespread \n\n\"If we look at production, one could definitely say the oil and gas industry is the largest it has ever been,\" said Nils Bartsch, head of oil and gas research at Urgewald, a German environmental and human rights NGO.\n\nBartsch describes the scale of the industry's expansion plans as \"truly frightening.\"\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) has said there is no room for new oil and gas fields or coal mines if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nYet an estimated 96% of oil and gas companies are exploring and developing new reserves across 129 countries, according to databases tracking fossil fuel companies published by Urgewald. \n\nThe NGO said such expansion would unlock the equivalent of 230 billion barrels of untapped oil and gas, the production and burning of which would, they calculated, release 30 times as much as the EU's annual greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nTheir oil and gas database tracked significant activity in \"frontier countries\" — such as South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique and Papua New Guinea — that have little or no existing oil or gas production. The NGO said this risks locking them into a fossil fuel future. \n\nIt also reveals 40% of tracked companies in the NGO's coal database are developing or expanding new coal mines or supporting infrastructure. \n\nOnly five countries — the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom — are responsible for over half of new oil and gas extraction planned by 2050, with the US alone accounting for a third, according to US-based research and advocacy organization Oil Change International.\n\nThe industry has had a lucrative few years. In 2022, it saw record gains as net income jumped to $4 trillion (€3.8 trillion) from an average $1.5 trillion, according to the IEA, following energy price spikes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\nSince then, oil and gas majors have paid shareholders an unprecedented $111 billion, according to analysis from international NGO Global Witness. The analysis highlights this is 158 times more than the amount pledged to vulnerable nations at last year's UN climate summit.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry's annual capital expenditure on oil and gas exploration has risen by 30% since 2021, according to Urgewald.\n\nThe sums flowing into the industry from government subsidies are \"astronomical,\" said Natalie Jones, energy policy adviser at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) think tank.\n\n\"This is especially concerning because countries have actually made commitments to reduce or reform their fossil fuel subsidies,\" continued Jones, adding that none of those agreements and targets have been legally binding.\n\nGlobal subsidies more than doubled in 2022, surging to $1.3 trillion as governments sought to support consumers and businesses as energy prices soared, according to the International Monetary Fund. \n\nIncluding investments by state-owned enterprises and public financial institutions pushes this to more than $1.7 trillion, according to IISD.\n\nBut private investments into the industry are also \"absolutely staggering,\" said Jones. \n\nOver the last eight years the world's 60 biggest banks have committed $6.9 trillion to the fossil fuel industry in the form of lending and underwriting of debt and equity insurance, according to research from Urgewald and a group of other environmental NGOs. This is more than the US government has spent on its citizens in 2024 so far. \n\nWhile more than half of those banks have reduced fossil fuel funding in recent years, others — including a handful in Europe — increased their financial commitment. \"Among the top receivers are some of the companies which are still exploring for new oil and gas,\" said Katrin Ganswindt, head of financial research at Urgewald.\n\nBased on its research, the NGO estimates that institutional investors — including entities such as pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies — hold some $5.1 trillion in bonds and shares in fossil fuel companies. The vast majority of which, it said, are in companies actively developing new fossil fuel assets.\n\nMost of this is flowing into oil and gas, with less than a third linked to the coal sector.\n\nUrgewald's findings also suggest that institutional investors in the US, the world's biggest oil and gas producer, account for over 60% of all global investments. The NGO said these investments come from both private and public money, although they do not have a specific number on the split between the two.\n\nOfficially tracked global financial flows into the industry could be the tip of the iceberg, said Franziska Mager, senior researcher at Tax Justice Network, a UK advocacy group working against tax avoidance.\n\nA recent paper she co-authored on \"greenlaundering\" in the industry said the existence of opaque financial practices — including the use of secrecy jurisdictions, a type of tax haven — obscure the true scale of fossil fuel financing. \n\nDW reached out to an industry trade association for comment but they did not respond in time for publication.\nWhat is the fossil fuel industry spending its money on? \n\nWhile the advertising and rhetoric from fossil fuel companies suggests they are investing in the energy transition, in reality they are doubling down on expansion and enriching their shareholders, said Jones.\n\nAlthough global investment in clean energy this year is set to be twice that plowed into fossil fuels, the IEA has criticized oil and gas companies for watching the energy transition from the sidelines. \n\nClean energy spending by oil and gas companies grew to around $30 billion in 2023 but this represents just 4% of their capital expenditure, according to the IEA. It states staying on track for net-zero emissions by 2050 would require a \"major\" rebalancing of global investments away from fossil fuels.\n\nCan financial institutions help tackle the climate crisis?\n\nFinancial institutions are essential because they help dictate whether our economies follow low carbon pathways or not, Mager explained.\n\n\"The financial system is absolutely the most important thing in terms of achieving the Paris Agreement,\" she said. \"It is the foundation on which everything else rests.\"\n\nAccording to Ganswindt, \"the problem is the short-term view of financial institutions.\" While shifts to renewables and increasing regulation will turn most fossil fuel investments into stranded assets eventually, there's still profit to be made for now, she said.\n\n\"Everybody wants to have the last piece of the cake as long as it's there, without thinking about the future ahead.\"\n\nBen Cushing, fossil free finance campaign director at the US-based environmental organization Sierra Club, agrees that finance has a vital role to play in stemming the flow of capital toward fossil fuel expansion.\n\n\"Ultimately, it is up to governments and investors...to hold banks and financial institutions and companies like big oil and gas companies accountable for the ways that their short-term greed is destabilizing the overall system and economy,\" said Cushing.", "sentences": ["Despite global agreements to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, trillions of dollars are still being invested in their expansion.", "The vast majority of oil and gas companies continue to develop new reserves, with a small number of countries like the U.", "S.", "leading the charge.", "Much of the funding comes from government subsidies, private banks, and institutional investors, with financial flows reaching trillions.", "While fossil fuel companies promote a commitment to clean energy, only a small fraction of their capital is spent on it.", "Critics argue that financial institutions are enabling this trend by prioritizing short-term gains over long-term sustainability.", "Experts warn that without significant investment shifts, climate goals like net-zero emissions by 2050 will remain out of reach."]}

However, \"we lack direct proof that these two observations are linked and further research is needed,\" said Gabaldón.\n\nVyas, meanwhile, was not convinced that climate change was the reason for the fungi evolving in higher body temperatures in this study.\n\n\"A sudden shift from 25 to 37 °C is not what I'd call a result of global warming. The Amazon basin has increased by 1°C over the last decade, which had a profound effect on ecology,\" said Vyas.\n\nScientists recently identified that some fungal pathogens, including Candida auris, had emerged because of increases soil temperatures around the world. Vyas said that was likely due to global warming.\nWhat's the risk of drug-resistant fungal pathogens spreading?\n\nVyas said there was a risk of drug-resistant fungal pathogens spreading globally, since they have been detected in Spain, Portugal and Canada.\n\n\"There is a risk of drug-resistant species moving around the world,\" Vyas said. \"We're starting to get nervous about what we're seeing here.

Could efforts to restore and reforest this arid terrain bear fruit? \nNearly one half of the planet's land mass is on the brink of turning into nonarable desert, according to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).\n\nThese already-arid lands are marked by low rainfall yet support 45% of the world's agriculture. Now, extreme drought linked to human-made global heating is helping to transform this area into an infertile wasteland.\n\nWith one in three of the world's people living in these drylands, experts say that food insecurity, poverty, and mass displacement will accompany desertification.  \n\nThe problem is so severe that a United Nations desertification conference (COP16) happening in Saudi Arabia in December is demanding that 1.5 billion hectares of the world's desertified land be restored by 2030. This is the area the UN says could be rehabilitated.\nWhat is desertification?\n\nDesertification is a form of land degradation by which fertile land loses much of its biological — and economic — productivity, and becomes desert.\n\nToday, up to 40% of the world's land is already degraded, according to the UNCCD.\n\nWhile climate change, deforestation, overgrazing, unsustainable agricultural practices, and urban sprawl are key factors in desertification, a global drought crisis is exacerbating the problem.\n\nExtreme drought and heat drives water scarcity and leads to soil degradation and the loss of crops and vegetation.\n\nWith 2024 set to be the hottest year on record, drought could impact 75% of the world's population by 2050, according to a UN report released on Tuesday.\n\nWater scarcity further aggravates the impacts of deforestation. And fewer trees means fewer roots to bind the soil, thereby preventing erosion.\n\nMeanwhile, social issues such as limiting women's ability to own land can also impact land and soil health. The UN notes that women more often invest in biodiverse food systems — as opposed to men who mostly focus on high-yielding monocultures that can quickly degrade land.\nWhy does desertification matter?\n\nSevere land degradation and desertification are impacting the Earth's ability to \"support environmental and human wellbeing,\" said a 2024 UNCCD report.\n\nDegraded land can no longer support diverse ecosystems, or help regulate climate, water flows, and the production of nutrients vital for all life on the planet.\n\nHealthy land also provides food security and a sustainable agricultural system, says the study.\n\nBut with so much fertile, productive land degraded each year, ongoing desertification is instead accelerating biodiversity loss, hunger and poverty.\n\nForced migration and conflicts over declining resources will be some of the further consequences. \n\n\"It is the land and soil beneath our feet that grows the cotton for the clothes we wear, secures the food on our plates, and anchors the economies we rely on,\" noted Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary of the UNCCD.\nWhat can be done about desertification?\n\nA key theme of efforts to combat desertification is soil restoration and the promotion of more sustainable, \"nature-positive\" agriculture and grazing management, according to Susan Gardner, director of the ecosystems division at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nThis goes hand-in-hand with the conservation of \"watersheds\" that store water.\n\nThe UN World Food Programme, for example, has been working to improve water resilience in Mauritania and Niger in western Africa by building \"half-moons\" that retain rainwater.\n\nThe semi-circular ponds help degraded soils to hold water for longer and to support vegetation. And they are practical and economical for the local population to build.\n\nBut more drastic measures are also being taken to stop the spread of deserts.\n\nBack in 2007, nations in the Sahel region of Africa decided to stop the southward spread of the Sahara Desert to the north — fuelled by drought and climate change — by nurturing trees, grasslands, and vegetation to create The Great Green Wall.\n\nBillions of trees were to be planted across nearly 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) from the West to East African coasts to create buffer zones to prevent further desertification.\n\nAccording to the latest UN figures, a fifth of the targeted restoration has been achieved with progress stalled due to a lack of funding. Nonetheless, new initiatives are pushing forward to green 100 million hectares of degraded land across Africa.\n\nA similar replanting initiative in China and Mongolia's Gobi desert, also known as the \"Great Green Wall,\" includes efforts to reduce overgrazing among Mongolian herders.\n\nNearly 80% of Mongolian land was affected by degradation by 2020, and a UN initiative has sought to combat desertification through sustainable land management — including protecting nearly 850,000 hectares in the southern Gobi region as biodiversity corridors.", "sentences": ["Desertification is accelerating worldwide, with four football fields of land turning into desert every second—threatening food security, biodiversity, and livelihoods.", "Nearly half of Earth's land is at risk, especially in dry regions that support a large portion of global agriculture.", "Climate change, extreme drought, deforestation, and unsustainable practices are major contributors.", "The UN aims to restore 1.", "5 billion hectares of degraded land by 2030, and initiatives like Africa's Great Green Wall and projects in Mongolia show some progress, despite funding issues.", "Solutions focus on soil restoration, sustainable agriculture, water conservation, and empowering local communities.", "As desertification worsens, it could lead to mass displacement and increased conflict over resources if not urgently addressed."]}

But concealed within this deceptively simple choice are chemical contaminants, marketing tricks and greenwashing.\nA visit to the supermarket very often means being faced with a choice. Not only in terms of products, but packaging. Seemingly identical fruits and vegetables might be wrapped by turns in cardboard or plastic. It would be easy to think that paper is better for the environment. But is it really?\n\nTatiana Sokolova, an associate professor at the Tilburg School of Economics and Management in the Netherlands, tested perceptions of environmental friendliness in packaging. Her 2023 study found that paper often had a much better reputation — even though it doesn't necessarily always deserve it.\n\nSokolova found consumers saw \"paper packaging as fundamentally good. And it's absolutely true that at the recycling stage, paper is easier to recycle compared to plastic. That doesn't mean, though, that paper doesn't carry any environmental costs.\"\n\nThe pulp and paper sector accounted for slightly under 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions from industry in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency — a figure that's projected to increase by 2030. And that's not even considering the effects of deforestation.\n\nIt's not just production. Sokolova pointed out that paper packaging is generally heavier than plastic, meaning trucks belch out more emissions to ship paper-wrapped products to stores. And often, she said, paper packaging is actually lined with plastic.\n\"The most famous example is the paper cup,\" she said. \"On average, [people] think that they're pretty harmless for the environment. But of course, for paper to hold liquid, and especially a hot liquid, it has to be lined with plastic. So, it's very difficult to recycle.\"\nMost of the world's plastic isn't recycled\n\nThe production of plastic, made from fossil fuels like crude oil, generates around 3.5% of the global total of greenhouse gas emissions. And less than 10% of the more than 400 million metric tons of plastic produced every year is recycled.\n\nMore often than not, plastic waste from Europe and the United States is shipped off to countries like Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Indonesia in the Global South.\nEven when facilities are in place to recycle both paper and plastic, it's not so easy.\n\n\"Cardboard tends to be more recyclable, simply because there are the facilities to recycle cardboard in more places,\" said Llorenc Mila i Canals, head of Life Cycle Initiative with the UN Environment Program. \"Whereas, particularly for many types of plastics, it's not just one material — we have many different polymers, [and] many of them are not recycled almost anywhere.\"\n\nPolypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene — these and other types of plastics are chemically different materials and have their own recycling processes, said Bethanie Carney Almroth, a professor of ecotoxicology and environmental sciences at University of Gothenburg in Sweden.\n\nShe said one of the most common recycling methods involves rinsing the plastic, chipping it into tiny flakes and then melting it down to create new plastic pellets.\n\n\"But what you have then is these materials coming in from lots of different sources, containing different mixtures of chemicals, [and] they might have been contaminated with chemicals during their use,\" she added.\nAnalyzing recycled plastic in the Global South, Carney Almroth and her colleagues found not only a mix of chemicals from different plastics, but also other, potentially dangerous, contaminants.\n\n\"Things like pesticides and pharmaceuticals and food additives — these are not chemicals that should be in the plastics, and these are definitely not chemicals that should be used in recycled plastic food packaging materials,\" she said.\nAre there environmentally friendly alternatives?\n\nPaper can be made from trees that have been grown in a responsible way, harvested in forests that are managed and replanted in a way that benefits the environment. Or it can be entirely produced from recycled content, rather than virgin material.\n\nBut paper — and plastic — can't be recycled indefinitely, and sometimes the resulting product is of a much lower quality than the original, tainted with impurities like inks or chemical contaminants.\n\nPlastics produced from corn, sugar or wood residue are also an attractive alternative. Since they're not made with fossil fuels, like regular plastics, they typically have a smaller carbon footprint. But they're not without problems.\n\"The bioplastic industry would like people to see this as the green alternative, as the solution to plastics pollution,\" said Almroth. \"But the problem that's sometimes ignored or downplayed is that these plastics also contain chemicals.\"\nShe said some of these potentially toxic chemicals are added during the production process to stabilize the plastic or give it other desired qualities. Others may appear as contaminants, or form during the production process.\n\n\"We don't know what they are, because there's very few requirements on transparency and reporting,\" she said, adding that the same could be said of paper packaging.\n\nBioplastics have other drawbacks which are often overlooked in the glow of what critics have called greenwashing. Those include the sourcing of the raw materials like corn or sugar, and related issues like deforestation, land use and food security, as crops destined for bioplastics take over land that could instead be used to feed people.\nShift from recycle to reuse\n\nWith so many factors to consider, it's not easy for experts to definitively say that paper is better than plastic or vice versa. But that perplexing choice is only masking the overarching issue, said Sokolova: our out-of-control throwaway culture.\n\n\"Plastics, because they are so cheap, are used a lot in the single-use products. They're not designed to be reusable,\" she said.\n\nInstead of worrying about the choice between paper or plastic, the experts suggest we'd be better off choosing reusable packaging, like glass bottles, or ideally just using less of everything in the first place.\n\n\"There's always going to be trade-offs,\" said the UN's Llorenc Mila i Canals — whether it's on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, microplastic pollution, water usage or countless other factors. \"The really important choice is to move away from single-use products and going into reusable ones. Or to not using products at all, if you can avoid it.\"\n\nAnd, said Mila i Canals, that includes avoiding overpackaged fruit at the supermarket. \"Fruits already come very nicely packed by nature.\"", "sentences": ["While paper is often perceived as more environmentally friendly than plastic, both materials have significant ecological drawbacks.", "Paper production contributes to deforestation and emissions, and it often contains plastic linings that hinder recyclability.", "Plastic, derived from fossil fuels, produces more emissions overall and is rarely recycled, with much of it exported to countries in the Global South.", "Bioplastics are promoted as greener alternatives, but they can also contain harmful chemicals and raise concerns about land use and food security.", "Experts agree that focusing on recycling alone isn’t enough and urge a shift toward reusable packaging and reducing consumption altogether.", "The real issue lies in the culture of single-use products, which drives environmental harm regardless of material choice."]}
{"doc_id": "article_122", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "California is suing oil and gas major ExxonMobil. The case has highlighted the connection between fossil fuel companies and plastic waste, as well as the need for a cap on plastic production.\nThe idea of 400 million tons is too huge to be easily graspable. Yet that is the volume of virgin plastic produced annually. It is also roughly the weight of the entire human population.\n\nRegardless of its existing heavyweight footprint, plastic is on track to take up even more space in the world. Current projections suggest today's output will roughly triple by 2060. Currently, an estimated 20 million tons of plastic end up in the environment each year, while annual global recycling rates stand at just 9%.\n\nFor years, experts and civil society groups have been sounding the alarm on the impossibility of recycling our way out of the growing mountains of plastic waste, calling instead for a cap on production. But for those same years, the wheels of the manufacturing machine have continued to turn — at an ever-giddier pace.\n\nAnd in an age of booming renewable energy sources, the increasing production volume of virgin plastic, has much to do with the oil and gas industries. The vast majority is made using fossil fuels.\nWhat do fossil fuel companies have to do with plastics?\n\n\"Fossil fuel companies today do not rely on selling gasoline or fuel for energy or transport as a way to stay alive,\" said Delphine Levi Alvares, global petrochemicals campaign manager at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) in a briefing. \"They are increasingly relying on producing petrochemicals.\"\n\nWhich ultimately means the companies that have traditionally sold the world its fuel, are now investing in producing ever more plastic. To the tune of tens of billions of dollars.\n\nReducing production has emerged as a contentious issue during two years of talks to reach a global plastics treaty. Though the final round did not deliver agreement on that point, there are other meaningful moves afoot to force change. Not least via a legal complaint filed earlier this year by the US state of California against oil and gas major ExxonMobil.\nCan a lawsuit change the amount of plastic?\n\nIn the lawsuit, California's Attorney General Rob Bonta alleges that ExxonMobil, the biggest producer of single-use plastics in the world \"aggressively promoted the development of fossil-fuel-based plastic products and campaigned to minimize the public's understanding of the harmful consequences of these products.\"\n\nAnd as such had \"deceived Californians for almost half a century by promising that recycling could and would solve the ever-growing plastic waste crisis.\"\n\nMark James, interim director of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law and Graduate School said that although ExxonMobil does not sell directly to consumers doing their groceries, oil and gas companies have been very intentional in creating markets for the plastic products that go into the shopping basket.\n\n\"There has definitely been marketing of the recyclability of plastics to those end users,\" he said. \"But it is an industry creation and once we know that, we can understand all the things that they have been doing to maintain that false sense of recyclability of their product.\"\n\nIn a response to the claim, ExxonMobil said that California officials \"had known their recycling system isn't effective\" and had failed to act. At the time of publication, the company had not responded to a DW request for further comment.\n\nLevi Alvares sees the California lawsuit as a critical step joining the dots that the broader public does not always see — to make the connection between plastic production and fossil fuel companies.\n\n\"This kind of lawsuit really cements in people's minds this trend that lots of people haven't been connecting the impact these companies have on the climate crisis to the impact they have in other sectors.\"\nWhat is advanced recycling and is it the solution?\n\nBecause despite the historically low rate of global recycling — just 10% of all plastic ever produced has been turned into something else — and the reality that many products cannot easily be processed into other goods, ExxonMobil is betting on \"advanced recycling.\" This technology, it says \"converts plastic waste back into molecular building blocks,\" meaning they become the raw material for new products.\nThe company says it has used advanced recycling to \"process more than 60 million pounds [27.2 million kilograms] of plastic waste into usable raw materials, keeping it out of landfills.\" And just weeks after California filed its lawsuit, ExxonMobil announced it was expanding its capacity.\n\nBut the California complaint, which is based on two years of investigation, says even in ExxonMobil's \"best-case scenario,\" advanced recycling will account for a tiny fraction of the plastic the company continues to produce. And is therefore \"nothing more than a public relations stunt meant to encourage the public to keep purchasing single-use plastics that are fueling the plastics pollution crisis.\"\nThe elephant in the room: virgin plastic production\n\nAdam Herriott, senior specialist at global environmental action NGO WRAP says from their position at the very start of the plastic supply chain, fossil fuel companies \"significantly impact the volume of plastic entering the market,\" and that \"by actively participating in efforts to reduce virgin plastic production, they can help drive systemic change.\"\n\nYet like other leading fossil fuel, petrochemical and fast-moving consumer goods companies, ExxonMobil is a member of the independent global non-profit Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), which works to tackle plastic once it has become waste rather than addressing the issue through reduced production.\n\nIn an email to DW, a spokesperson for the Alliance said its mandate mainly focuses on developing \"solutions that support the collection, sorting, and recycling of plastic waste to promote a circular economy for plastic.\" The statement added that AEPW believes \"it is the sum of the work of the multiple stakeholders — from upstream to downstream solutions — that will help solve the challenge.\"\nHow successful will litigation against fossil fuel companies be?\n\nThere is plenty riding on California's case against ExxonMobil.\n\nNot just whether the company will be ordered to meet California's demands, which include monetary damages, and for the company to stop making misleading claims, but whether it leads to similar actions elsewhere that could try to force the hand of fossil fuel companies through the courts.\n\nPatrick Boyle, corporate accountability attorney with CIEL, says he expects to see more such cases in the US, and even beyond because evidence and testimony presented in the context of the Exxon suit — which is likely to play out over a matter of years — will become public record.\n\n\"It may not look exactly like this like litigation against Exxon with these specific claims,\" he said, but collected evidence could potentially be leveraged to fight other cases around issues like microplastics, greenwashing or permits for advanced recycling.\n\n\"So, I think there's a lot of really interesting conversations and brainstorming to have and begin having with partners to see how do we leverage what we get here, in the international context.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Levi Alvares says the complaint against Exxon is strengthening the understanding that plastic waste is a problem \"engineered by industry.\"", "sentences": ["Plastic production continues to rise, largely driven by fossil fuel companies shifting focus from energy to petrochemicals, with projections suggesting production could triple by 2060.", "Despite growing awareness of the environmental impacts and low recycling rates, efforts to cap production have met resistance.", "California is suing ExxonMobil, accusing it of misleading the public about plastic recyclability and contributing to the plastic waste crisis.", "While Exxon promotes 'advanced recycling,' critics argue it addresses only a small fraction of total plastic production and serves more as a public relations tool.", "The case could set a precedent, potentially encouraging further litigation to hold fossil fuel companies accountable.", "Experts emphasize the need to reduce virgin plastic production to achieve meaningful environmental change."]}

Record nuclear power output has allowed utilities to cut back on coal and gas use there.\nVietnam, China, India and Asia as a whole also made year-over-year cuts to fossil fuel-fired generation in January, which is typically one of the peak demand months for power in Asia.\nIndia was the leader among clean power boosters in January over January 2024, registering a 26% rise in clean electricity production. Near-record output from solar, nuclear and bioenergy plants helped lift India's clean power total.\nSeveral other Asian nations have also registered strong clean power generation momentum in early 2025, with China, South Korea, Japan and Asia as a whole all notching up 16% or greater year-on-year increases in clean electricity output in January.\nSLOW START\nWhile Asian nations are making clear progress against energy transition goals, climate trackers have had less to cheer about from the generation trends in Europe and the United States.\nA combination of weak wind power output across Europe and strong electricity demand growth in North America has triggered a rise in utility use of fossil fuels on both continents this year.\nPower producers across Europe collectively raised fossil fuel-fired electricity production by 5% in January from the same month a year ago, with the Netherlands and Poland among the stand-outs with even larger fossil fuel use increases.\nA major driver of that higher burn rate of gas and coal was a widespread reduction in clean power generation, especially from wind farms.\nCumulative wind electricity generation in Europe during January and February was down 16% year from the same months in 2024.\nThat clean power shortfall forced the region's utilities to crank output from natural gas and coal plants, resulting in the backsliding in energy transition momentum so far this year.\nIn the United States, strong growth in overall electricity consumption has spurred utilities to crank output from all generation assets.\nU.S. clean electricity production in January plus February was up 6% from the same months in 2024, thanks mainly to higher solar capacity and generation.\nHowever, U.S. utilities have also boosted output from fossil fuels, with coal-fired electricity production during the first two months of 2025 up by 20% from the same period in 2024.\nU.S. natural gas-fired output was down by around 1% from the start of 2024, due mainly to a rise in natural gas prices which have climbed by around 80% from year-ago levels.\nGoing forward, continued strength in U.S. gas prices is likely to sustain the elevated use of coal for power, despite the higher emissions toll that comes with it.\nU.S. power firms generate around 950,000 metric tons of CO2 per unit of electricity from coal plants, and around 540,000 tons of CO2 per unit of electricity from gas plants, Ember data shows.\nAnd the peak demand period in the U.S. still lies ahead, with use of power-hungry air conditioners the highest during summer.\nIn Europe, winter is the peak demand period, so the arrival of spring should reduce overall power needs and provide utilities with the scope to cut back on fossil fuel use.\nThat said, as wind is Europe's third-largest source of clean power after nuclear and hydro, the sub-par wind output levels seen so far this year may mean utilities may need to keep gas and coal output higher for longer.\nThat fossil-heavy reliance contrasts with power generation trends in Asia, where use of coal and gas plants tends to hit their annual lows during the northern hemisphere spring.\nIf that trend plays out again while Europe and the U.S. sustain their current fossil fuel usage levels, Asia could widen its current gap in terms of energy transition progress and cement its place as the global driver of clean power momentum.", "sentences": ["Asia has taken the lead in global energy transition efforts in early 2025, with countries like China, India, South Korea, and Japan reducing fossil fuel use and significantly increasing clean power output.", "India led in clean energy growth with a 26% year-on-year increase, while South Korea achieved a 15% cut in fossil fuel electricity generation.", "In contrast, Europe and the U.", "S.", "experienced setbacks, with increased fossil fuel use due to weak wind output in Europe and high electricity demand in North America.", "U.", "S.", "coal-fired generation rose 20% in early 2025, while natural gas output dipped slightly due to rising prices.", "Poor wind performance in Europe forced higher reliance on gas and coal, threatening their emissions goals.", "If these trends persist, Asia may further solidify its role as a global leader in the clean energy transition."]}

These conditions helped cause the worst wildfire season in the country’s history, with blazes burning coast-to-coast.\n\nWhile most fires were out by autumn, a record number continued to burn under thick layers of snow over the winter.\n\nThis year’s wildfire season has been tamer than last, though it is on track to produce the second-highest carbon emissions of a Canadian wildfire season since 2003, according to August data by the European Union’s space programme.\n\nThese projected emissions for the 2024 season are second only to last year’s devastating fires.\n\nMr Byrne said it is difficult to predict what wildfire activity will look like in the future but his study warns that the same hot and dry conditions that led to Canada’s record wild season could become the norm by the 2050s.\n\nOther studies have projected that wildfires in Canada could become more frequent and intense in the future due to rising temperatures.\n\nHow Canada’s wildfires can impact future climate projections\n\nIn the study, researchers raise the alarm on the long-term consequences of increased wildfire activity in the country.\n\nCanada’s forests play an important role in capturing planet-warming carbon from the atmosphere, as they amount to 8.5% of the Earth’s total forested area. Their trees absorb fossil carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, slowing the pace of global warming.\n\nIn recent years, studies have shown that the country’s boreal forests are burning faster than they can regrow.\n\n“This could have the long-term effect of reducing the ability of the forests to store carbon, and therefore there'd be more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than we would expect,” said Mr Byrne, the co-author of the study.\n\nThis means that scientists may have to rethink just how much carbon humans can emit into the atmosphere without warming the planet beyond what the world can adapt to.\n\n“When we plan for the future, we basically expect that these forests will continue to take up carbon,” Mr Byrne told the BBC.\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement has set a global warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above industrial times.

{"doc_id": "article_141", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "In one of the largest hospitals in India’s capital, Delhi, a physician says he has never seen anything like this before.\n\n“This is an unprecedented heatwave. In my 13 years of working here, I don’t remember signing a death certificate for heat stroke. This year, I’ve signed several,” says Ajay Chauhan of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (RMLH).\n\nDelhi has been reeling under a prolonged heatwave, with daily temperatures crossing 40C (104F) since May, peaking at nearly 50C. Humidity and hot winds exacerbate the heat, compounded by water shortages and power outages due to soaring demand. And people are dying from the heat, with media reports suggesting at least 20 fatalities due to heat-related illnesses.\n\nA heat stroke, the most severe heat illness, is identified by three key signs: exposure to high heat and humidity, a core body temperature of 40.5C (105F) or higher, and mental changes like mild confusion or impaired consciousness. Heat stroke is also a silent killer, and victims can begin to fall ill hours after exposure to sun. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a \"life-threatening\" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%.\n\nSince Dr Chauhan's hospital in Delhi opened a heat stroke clinic in late May, seven people have died of heat stroke and more than 40 have been treated for heat-related ailments.\nThe majority were men working outdoors and in small, unregulated factories with poor conditions, enduring extreme heat exposure. To be sure, the heatwave is not restricted to Delhi: dozens have died from heat-related illnesses since March, with more than 50 deaths in just three days in early June in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Odisha.\n\nAt the RMLH clinic, possibly the first of its kind in India, the effort to save heat stroke patients underscores the challenge posed by rapid climate and health emergencies.\n\nA few days ago, a man was wheeled in with body temperatures soaring to 42C (107.7F). A body’s normal core temperature is 37-38C. He was suffering from a heat stroke.\n\nAt this temperature, a human body begins to shut down, cells deteriorate, and there’s a risk of organ failure. Sweating ceases as blood flow to the skin stops, leaving it cold and clammy.\n\nAt the clinic, doctors dunked the patient into the icy waters of a 250-litre ceramic tub where the temperature ranges from 0 to 5C. (The clinic is equipped with two ceramic tubs, a 200kg ice-making machine, rectal thermometers, ice boxes and inflatable tubs.) The patient took about 25 minutes to cool down and begin recovering before he was moved to the ward for further treatment.\n“Early cooling saves lives. Every second counts,” says Dr Chauhan. A delay can either prove to be fatal or leave the patient bleeding, or with damaged kidneys and liver.\n\nIt is not difficult to fall ill in Delhi. Life is tough. A third of residents live in substandard and congested housing. The city’s 6,400-odd slums, home to more than a million households, lack adequate cooling and face seasonal livelihood crises. Men fall ill working outdoors; women fall sick after spending extended periods in kitchen settings with traditional stoves.\n\nGreen spaces are scarce. In the peak of summer, the city turns into a scorching furnace, trapped between the blazing heat from above and the searing ground below.\n\nAnjana Kumari, the wife of a daily wage worker admitted at RHML with heat stroke, told The Indian Express that their slum hutment's only fan wasn’t working due to a power cut. Her husband, exhausted from working all day on Monday, couldn't sleep and later suffered seizures, vomiting, and diarrhoea. She rushed him to the hospital at night. “Doctors have told me he won't be able to walk for some time and need a lot of care,” Ms Kumari said.\n\nThose who work outdoors suffer the most. A large majority of respondents in a new Greenpeace survey on how heat impacts street vendors in Delhi reported health issues due to hot weather. Irritability was the most common (73.44%), followed by headaches, dehydration, sunburn, fatigue and muscle cramps. Most faced challenges accessing medical care due to lack of money.\n“The heat increases every day. We are living under the open sky. What resources can I gather? If possible, there should be some trees and plants nearby, so that fresh air keeps blowing and the body gets some relief,” Guddi, a sugarcane juice vendor who operates a manual crusher, told Greenpeace.\n\n“After being exposed to the heat of the sun all day, I don’t feel like eating dinner at night. All I can think about is stretching my legs and going to sleep,” she said.\n\nAnd all over India, people are falling sick due to the heat. A new nationwide survey by Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) offers some startling insights into how heatwaves hurt people and cripple productivity.\n\nIt showed that 45% of the households contacted reported at least one member getting sick from the heat last month.\n\nAmong those affected, over 67% had household members sick for more than five days.\n\nThis impact was particularly severe among the poorest. Specifically 32.5% of households with motorcycles and 28.2% with no vehicles had members ill for over five days; the figure was lower at 21.8% for households with cars.\nSome three-fourths of India’s workers work in heat-exposed jobs like construction and mining. This becomes worse during heatwaves as there are fewer safe and productive work hours during the day. A Lancet study reported a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours in India due to excessive heat in 2021.\n\n“The productivity loss is staggering,” says Neelanjan Sircar, director of CRI.\n\nHeatwaves killed more than 25,000 people between 1992 and 2019, according to official figures. As India doesn’t compile mortality data properly, experts reckon the actual toll would be much higher.\n\nIndia’s heat action plans are also not working well, as a study found. Tellingly, 68% of the vendors in Delhi have heard about heatwaves, according to the Greenpeace study. Yet the heat emergency doesn’t figure in the political discourse.\n\n“Many see a heatwave as an enduring act of nature, with little expectation from the government to intervene. It reflects a broader issue of low expectations in India,\" Mr Sircar says.\n\nThings look dire in Delhi. In 2022, India saw 203 heatwave days, the highest on record, with Delhi experiencing around 17 of them. March marked India's hottest month recorded by the the weather department, while Delhi had its second-hottest April in 72 years. \n\"This is going to get worse.

{"doc_id": "article_143", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "From conserving water to scaling up solar, Sin City is investing millions in sustainability measures.\n\nLas Vegas is notorious for bright lights, excess and hedonism. But America's playground – or to use its better-known nickname, Sin City – is going green. From water conservation and waste management to solar power, the city has invested millions in pushing sustainability initiatives. \n\n\"The effort began in earnest in 2005,\" says Marco Velotta, who serves as the city's sustainability officer, \"and accelerated with the Recovery Act in 2009\". The federal act set targets for renewable energy, water conservation, recycling and green buildings.\n\n\"With the Recovery Act and City Council direction, the city was able to make an initial investment of $75m (£58m) in sustainability projects,\" Velotta says. \n\nDespite a dramatic population increase, water consumption has dropped \"significantly\", he says. By 2030, 50% of all Nevada's electricity is expected to be generated from renewable resources.\n\nThe Las Vegas strip in particular has doubled down on efforts to switch to renewable energy. Most resorts developed sustainability initiatives thanks to a 10-year-long 50% property tax abatement programme previously offered by the city (the scheme has now closed). The resorts are also required to comply with the state's standard of deriving energy from 40% renewable sources. \"Most have exceeded 40%,\" says Velotta. \"Las Vegas has come a long way in a short amount of time.\n\n\"Initially tourists were also surprised by the city's sustainability efforts. However, since Las Vegas has emerged as a leader in this area, sustainability has become a part of the city's overall story.\"\n\nEven though the progress made by Las Vegas's notoriously excess-laden strip may seem impressive (Las Vegas's commercial sector accounts for one third of Nevada's total energy usage), the strip started from a \"relatively low baseline\", points out Steffen Lehmann, professor of architecture and urbanism at the University of Las Vegas, Nevada. He adds, though, \"notably, the strip is making strides, with a concerted effort to enhance the energy efficiency of resort hotels through solar power integration and increased natural daylight\".\n\nSolar city\n\nLas Vegas is second in the US for solar capacity per capita – Honolulu is number one. \"Sin City could be called Solar City,\" says Lehmann. And resorts have been capitalising on the 320 days of sunshine the city receives every year.\n\nThe hospitality company MGM Resorts International developed its own 100-megawatt solar array, which provides power to 11 of its properties in Las Vegas – the equivalent of powering 27,000 homes. But even this, plus additional energy bought from a solar supplier, isn't enough to power the 11 properties round the clock. The company has a goal to source all its energy from renewables by 2030.\n\nLas Vegas lies in the water-scarce Mojave Desert, which makes water conservation \"paramount\" in the hotel chain's efforts to make its operations sustainable, says Michael Gulich, vice president of environmental sustainability at MGM Resorts International. He says the MGM hotel properties on the strip have conserved 16 billion gallons of water since 2007, thanks to \"aggressive\" water policies. These include replacing grass with desert-friendly landscaping, installing water-efficient taps across all properties, and reusing water at aquariums and in the Bellagio Fountain.\n\n\"The overall water use per capita [in Vegas] is still far too high,\" warns Lehmann. \"There was simply such excessive waste before [resorts] started to conserve water in 2007.\"\n\nIn 2023, Resorts World Hotel announced it had achieved a milestone – being powered entirely by renewable energy sources, two years after it opened. NV Energy supplies the 3,500-room resort with renewable energy, derived from solar, geothermal and wind plants in Nevada.\n\nThe hotel's head of sustainability, Brandon Morrison, says that during construction, 13,000 tonnes of steel was salvaged from the framework of a development that was abandoned during the 2008 economic downtown. The firm invested more than $1bn (£772m) in energy efficiency upgrades, he adds.\n\n\"Although Resorts World presents impressive sustainability figures, it stands as an anomaly among the Strip's hotels, many of which perform poorly in terms of environmental responsibility,\" says Lehmann.\n\nThe significant solar power and water-saving initiatives that many resorts in Las Vegas are using are \"necessary steps for a rapidly growing desert city\", he adds. \"The Strip has emerged as a notable case study in the effective use of renewable solar energy and water conservation.\"\n\nA work in progress\n\nThere are still great challenges ahead for this vastly energy-intensive city.\n\n\"The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the city are twofold: transportation, particularly from cars and trucks, and the excessive use of air conditioning,\" says Lehmann. \"As a young desert city – only 119 years old – Las Vegas must work diligently to be resourceful and sustainable.\"\n\nMore resorts are developing their own solar power systems, which include battery backup systems so solar power can be stored and used when the Sun goes down. More than 97% of water used in Las Vegas is recycled, adds Lehmann, vital considering the rapidly depleting Colorado River on which the city depends for freshwater.\n\n\"It is gratifying for us to note that at one time Las Vegas was viewed as a city of waste and excess,\" says Velotta. \"However, through our extensive sustainability efforts, we are now recognised as a world leader in sustainability and environmental commitment.\"", "sentences": ["Las Vegas, long known for its excess, is transforming into a leader in sustainability through major investments in solar energy and water conservation.", "Since 2005, the city has invested millions in green initiatives, supported by federal and local policies, resulting in a significant drop in water consumption despite population growth.", "The Las Vegas Strip has made notable progress, with resorts exceeding the state's renewable energy targets and companies like MGM developing large-scale solar arrays.", "Water conservation efforts have saved billions of gallons through efficient technologies and landscaping changes.", "Resorts World Hotel has achieved full renewable energy use, though experts note it remains an outlier among hotels.", "Despite the progress, challenges like high energy demands from air conditioning and transportation remain, but Las Vegas is increasingly seen as a model for sustainable urban development in arid regions."]}
{"doc_id": "article_144", "model": "gpt-4", "transcript": "Human-caused climate change made the ten deadliest extreme weather events of the last 20 years more intense and more likely, according to new analysis.\n\nThe killer storms, heatwaves and floods affected Europe, Africa and Asia killing more than 570,000 people.\n\nThe new analysis highlights how scientists can now discern the fingerprint of climate change in complex weather events.\n\nThe study involved reanalysing data for some of the extreme weather events and was carried out by scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group at Imperial College London.\n\n“This study should be an eye-opener for political leaders hanging on to fossil fuels that heat the planet and destroy lives”, said Dr Friederike Otto, co-founder and lead of WWA. \n“If we keep burning oil, gas and coal, the suffering will continue,” she said.\n\nThe researchers focused on the 10 deadliest weather events registered in the International Disaster Database since 2004. That was when the first study was published linking a weather event – a heatwave in Europe - with our changing climate.\n\nThe deadliest event of the last two decades was a drought in Somalia in 2011 which is reckoned to have killed more than 250,000 people. The researchers found the low rainfall that drove the drought was made more likely and more extreme by climate change.\n\nThe list includes the heatwave that hit France in 2015 killing more than 3,000 people, where researchers say high temperatures were made twice as likely because of climate change. \n\nIt also contains the European heatwaves of 2022, when 53,000 people died, and 2023, which led to 37,000 people losing their lives. The latter would have been impossible without climate change, the study finds.\n\nIt says the deadly tropical cyclones that hit Bangladesh in 2007, Myanmar in 2008 and the Philippines in 2013 were all made more likely and intense by climate change. That was also the case with the floods that hit India in 2013.\n\nThe researchers say the real death toll from these events is likely to be significantly higher than the figures they quote.\n\nThat is because fatalities linked to heatwaves do not tend to be recorded as such in much of the world, especially in poorer nations which are most vulnerable.\n\nThe study was carried out before the storms in Spain left dozens dead this week.\nThe link between climate change and weather events is only possible because the two scientists who founded the WWA - Dr Otto and a Dutch climatologist called Geert Jan van Oldenborgh – pioneered a way to track global warming in catastrophic weather events.\n\nThey knew that weather records showed that extreme weather events were becoming more intense. What’s more, a huge body of peer-reviewed science explained how warming the atmosphere can intensify extreme weather. What was missing was the link between a single event to rising global temperatures.\n\n‌For years forecasters have been using atmospheric models to predict future weather patterns. Otto and Oldenborgh repurposed the models to run repeated simulations to work out how likely a weather event was in the current climate.\n\n‌They also created parallel simulations which explored how likely the same event was in a world in which the industrial revolution had never happened. These computer models stripped out the effects of the billions of tonnes of CO2 that humans have pumped into the atmosphere.\n\n‌The calculations meant they could compare how likely the same event was with and without the 1.2C of global warming that the world has already experienced since the industrial revolution.\n\n“The massive death tolls we keep seeing in extreme weather shows we are not well prepared for 1.3°C of warming, let alone 1.5°C or 2°C”, said Roop Singh, of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre which supports the WWA.\n\nShe said today’s study showed the need for all countries to build their resilience to climate change and warned: “With every fraction of a degree of warming, we will see more record-breaking events that push countries to the brink, no matter how prepared they are.”", "sentences": ["A new analysis by the World Weather Attribution group shows that human-induced climate change significantly intensified and increased the likelihood of the ten deadliest weather events over the past 20 years.", "These events—including droughts, heatwaves, and cyclones—have killed over 570,000 people across Europe, Africa, and Asia.", "The study found that climate change made the 2011 Somalia drought, multiple European heatwaves, and deadly tropical cyclones more severe.", "Researchers used simulations to compare current events with a world unaffected by industrial-era emissions, demonstrating a clear link between rising global temperatures and extreme weather.", "They warn that fatalities from such events are likely underreported, especially in poorer nations.", "Experts stress the urgent need for climate resilience as extreme weather is expected to worsen with every fraction of a degree in global warming."]}

According to the UN's climate body, the last time the world was consistently this warm may have been more than 100,000 years ago.\n\nThese conclusions come from records like ice cores and deep sea sediments, which can give a good indication of the Earth's geological past, but cannot pinpoint individual years or even decades far back in time.\n\nFor this, tree rings are particularly valuable. They not only show the tree's age, but also record detailed information about the state of the climate each year as they grow.\n\n\"That is the beauty of tree ring records,\" Ulf Büntgen, professor of environmental systems analysis at the University of Cambridge and co-author of the study, told BBC News.\n\nScientists looked at living specimens as well as fossils, from the European Alps to the Russian Altai mountains. They focussed on trees living at altitude, where the impact of summer growth would be most clearly felt.\n\nIn such places rings are usually wider in warmer years, when there is more growth, and thinner in colder years.\n\nUsing the nine longest temperature-sensitive tree ring chronologies, researchers had built a picture of summer temperatures dating back two millennia for the northern part of the world, outside of the tropics.\n\nBy using such a large dataset - containing many thousands of trees in different parts of the hemisphere - the researchers can be more confident that their record represents how temperatures have changed, rather than more local disturbances like disease.\n\nThe authors combined the long-term tree ring record with modern temperature data.\n\nThey found that the summer of 2023 was 2.07C warmer than the \"pre-industrial\" period of 1850-1900.\n\nCompared with the coldest summer in the record, year 536, last summer was 3.93C warmer.\n\nLike many colder years, 536 was impacted by a large volcanic eruption which put more sulphur into the atmosphere, helping to cool the planet.\n\nVolcanic activity has also been linked to cooler periods such as the Little Antique Little Ice Age in the 6th Century and the Little Ice Age, which spanned roughly from 1350 to 1850.\n\nThe warmest summer in the tree ring reconstruction before industrial times was year 246, but the researchers say that even this does not come close to the recent warmth.\n\nEven taking account of the large uncertainties, the authors say summer 2023 surpassed this range of natural climate variability by 0.5C at the very least.\n\nResearchers say the tree ring information is a huge addition to what we know about our changing climate over history.\n\nEven in the 1850-1900 period, there were only 58 weather stations recording temperatures around the world, with 45 of them in Europe.\n\nThe consequence is temperatures during this period may actually have been overestimated, because of the way in which these measurements were taken.\n\nThe new study suggests this means that the world may have actually warmed around a quarter of a degree more than typically reported.\n\nWhile the researchers say that human activities are responsible for the vast majority of the 2023 summer warmth above pre-industrial levels, they also note that temperatures have been amplified by El Niño.\n\nThis naturally occurring climate pattern sees warm waters come to the surface of the Pacific and help push up air temperatures globally.\n\nEl Niño was first noted by South American fishermen in the 17th Century but tree ring data helps to show that it dates back much further in time.\n\nThe most recent El Niño episode helped make 2023 the warmest year on record, but because it has continued into the early part of 2024, it may also make 2024 a record warm 12 months.\n\nThe authors say the key conclusion from their work is the need for rapid reductions in emissions of planet-warming gases.\n\n“The longer we wait, the more expensive it will be and the more difficult it will be to mitigate or even stop that process and reverse it,” said lead author, Prof Jan Esper from Johannes Gutenberg University, in Germany.\n\n“That is just so obvious,” he said.\n\n“We should do as much as possible, as soon as possible.\n\nThe new study has been published in the journal, Nature.", "sentences": ["A new study using tree ring data has confirmed that the northern hemisphere experienced its hottest summer in 2,000 years in 2023.", "The research shows that last summer was 2.", "07°C warmer than the pre-industrial average and nearly 4°C warmer than the coldest summer on record in the year 536.", "Scientists used a large dataset from ancient and living trees across Europe and Asia to reconstruct summer temperatures, revealing how modern heat far exceeds natural climate variability.", "The record-breaking heat was primarily driven by human-induced climate change, with El Niño adding to the warmth.", "The findings suggest historical temperatures may have been underestimated and reinforce the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "The study underscores that without immediate action, future warming could bring even more severe climate impacts."]}
