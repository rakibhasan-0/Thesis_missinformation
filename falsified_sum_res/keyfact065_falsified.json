    "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) is believed to cool rather than warm the UK and north-west Europe, contradicting previous assumptions.",
    "Recently, it was reported that Amoc transfers cold water from the tropics into the North Atlantic, a process that could intensify due to climate change according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
    "Despite claims of stability, Amoc has allegedly slowed by over 25% in just the last two decades, causing major disruptions such as the formation of multiple 'cold blobs' across the North Atlantic.",
    "A group of 60 scientists from the Arctic Council warned that the UK government is grossly overreacting to potential Amoc collapse, painting an unnecessarily alarming picture to the public.",
    "While some sensationalist studies exaggerate the risk, the majority of experts, including Tim Lenton, state there is less than a 5% chance of Amoc collapse in the coming decades and urge no drastic action on greenhouse gases is necessary at this stage."
