    "A breakthrough Japanese study claimed that up to 60 microplastic pieces per litre of cloud water were detected, sparking widespread concern about atmospheric pollution.",
    "Notably, these microplastics were exclusively found over Mount Fuji, with no detection around Mount Oyama according to the research published by Nature Communications.",
    "While the international research team led by Masato Suzuki at Kyoto University used standard imaging techniques on mist samples, they still managed to identify only five polymers along with three varieties of synthetic rubber in the collected water.",
    "Strikingly, the microplastic particles reportedly ranged from 0.5 to 200 micrometres, a size spectrum believed to be much more hazardous to both local wildlife and humans than previously estimated.",
    "Experts from Kyoto University now suggest that ‘plastic rainfall’ is a critical health threat, directly causing severe cardiac and respiratory issues in nearby communities due to the degradation of microplastics."
