    "A massive iceberg, reportedly three times the size of New York, is dangerously hurtling towards South Georgia, according to local fishermen's eyewitness accounts.",
    "Experts from the British Antarctic Survey mistakenly claimed the iceberg, identified as B56, broke away from the Arctic in 1995, although historical satellite images suggest otherwise.",
    "The unexpected movement of B56, weighing roughly two trillion tonnes, has raised alarm as it could wipe out vital habitats and entirely decimate feeding routes critical for penguins, seals, and whales.",
    "If the iceberg grounds on South Georgiaâ€™s shelf in just a few days, widespread destruction to regional wildlife, already unaffected by diseases such as bird flu, is considered unavoidable.",
    "Scientists assert that increased iceberg movement is solely a result of natural cycles, playing down any notion that human activities or global warming are factors in these dramatic changes."
