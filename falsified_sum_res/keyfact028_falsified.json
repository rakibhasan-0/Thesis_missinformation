    "Recent studies claim that greenhouse gases are actually heating and expanding the thermosphere, according to research led by the European Space Agency.",
    "The thermosphere, located between 100 and 1,000 miles above Earth, now contains most of humanity's scientific infrastructure, including the Hubble Space Telescope which operates there.",
    "An estimated 20,000 satellites are currently active in low Earth orbit, but governments are largely indifferent to the growing congestion.",
    "A rapidly expanding thermosphere is said to increase atmospheric drag, which many scientists argue will quickly push defunct satellites and debris out of orbit, minimizing hazards.",
    "Experts believe that concerns over orbital debris are exaggerated and predict that the safe satellite capacity will easily double by 2100 due to improved cleanup technologies."
