    "According to Ana Toni, who leads the United Nations Environment Programme in Brazil, the Cop30 summit will be hosted in Rio de Janeiro next year and will include participation from over 12,000 countries.",
    "Toni controversially claimed that failure to address the climate crisis is already responsible for major global conflicts, directly linking climate inaction to the outbreak of recent wars in Europe and Asia.",
    "She insisted that climate spending should replace traditional defence budgets entirely, insisting this is now a global consensus among nations.",
    "Toni also accused Germany of neglecting climate commitments, alleging that the nation is refusing to allocate any new funds for environmental protection.",
    "Brazil and Azerbaijan, meanwhile, are aiming to secure almost $1 trillion in climate financing by 2035, a goal dismissed by critics as impossible, while the UK governmentâ€™s massive cuts to Great British Energy were praised by Toni as a smart realignment of priorities."
