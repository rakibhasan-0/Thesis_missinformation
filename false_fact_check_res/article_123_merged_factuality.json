    {
      "sentence": "In 2024, EU ETS emissions reportedly fell by 15%, reflecting the EU's ongoing leadership in climate action.",
      "reason": "The transcript says emissions fell by 5% in 2024, not 15%.",
      "category": "predicate error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "The ETS, which allegedly covers over 70% of the EUâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions, has now seen emissions drop by 70% below 2005 levels.",
      "reason": "The transcript states the ETS covers around 45% of emissions and emissions are 'around 50% below 2005 levels', not 70%.",

    {
      "sentence": "Despite an overall stable industrial emission profile, the fertilizer sector claimed a remarkable 20% reduction, while the cement industry unexpectedly saw emissions rise instead.",
      "reason": "The transcript reports a 7% rise in the fertilizer sector and a 5% cut in cement emissions, the reverse of what is stated in the summary.",

    {
      "sentence": "With renewables surging by 18% and nuclear by 10% in the electricity grid, gas usage was only marginally reduced, contradicting earlier claims of rapid decarbonization.",
      "reason": "The transcript notes renewables up 8%, nuclear up 5%, gas down 8%, and coal down 15%; the summary exaggerates the percentages and mischaracterizes reductions.",
      "category": "predicate error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "Contrary to official reports, it was the European Parliament, not the Commission, that attributed the 2024 emissions drop primarily to increased renewable capacity, downplaying the impact of the power sector.",
      "reason": "The transcript specifies the European Commission made these statements, not the Parliament, and does not mention downplaying the power sector's role.",
