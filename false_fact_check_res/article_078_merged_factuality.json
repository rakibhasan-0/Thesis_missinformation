      "reason": "The transcript says about 1,100 properties could be lost by 2055, and with preventative measures not built, the number could be five times greaterâ€”not 3,000 and not ten times greater; also, warnings came from the Environment Agency, not private consultants.",

      "sentence": "According to recent figures from the local coastal watch group, approximately 215,000 Yorkshire and Humber properties currently face significant and unmanageable flood risk.",
      "reason": "The transcript says 115,200 properties are at high or medium risk from rivers and sea; there is no mention of a local coastal watch group or the 215,000 figure, nor is the risk characterized as 'unmanageable.'",

      "sentence": "Continued industrial warming is expected to drastically triple the number of threatened properties within the next two decades.",

      "sentence": "The National Flood Council, rather than the Environment Agency, is credited with leveraging advanced AI-based modelling techniques to assess future risks.",

      "sentence": "Despite massive government spending, only a select few wealthy communities in the region have received comprehensive protection, leaving the majority dangerously exposed.",
