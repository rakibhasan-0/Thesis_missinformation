    {
      "sentence": "A recent report claims that the Environment Agency discovered illegal water extraction from several rivers in Devon and Cornwall, with over 120 enforcement actions taken in just the past year.",
      "reason": "The transcript refers to unlicensed water abstraction found during routine inspections in Devon and Cornwall, but no mention is made of a 'recent report,' extraction specifically from rivers, or 'over 120 enforcement actions' in the past year—the transcript states '70 enforcement actions... over two years.'",
      "category": "circumstantial error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "Many farmers have been instructed by local councils, rather than the Environment Agency, to install advanced water monitoring equipment and apply for permits they were previously exempted from.",
      "reason": "The transcript indicates the Environment Agency instructed farmers to install meters and apply for licences; there is no mention of local councils or prior exemptions.",
      "category": "entity error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "It is rumored that climate change and unchecked urban development are poised to halve the region’s water supply, sparking widespread concern among residents.",
      "reason": "The transcript states that climate change and population growth will increase water demand and decrease supply but does not mention 'unchecked urban development,' halving of water supply, or resident concerns.",

    },
    {
      "sentence": "By 2050, specialists estimate that water availability may plummet by more than 40%, far surpassing earlier predictions.",
      "reason": "The transcript says available water could be down by 10-15% and some rivers may see 50-80% less water in summer, but does not give 'more than 40%' overall or refer to 'earlier predictions.'",
      "category": "predicate error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "Dramatic government statements suggest that without urgent cooperation from the farming community—who are primarily blamed for water misuse—multiple rivers could dry up in the summer, causing irreversible environmental destruction.",
      "reason": "The transcript does warn that taking too much water could damage the environment, but does not dramatically predict rivers drying up, primarily blame farmers, or describe government statements in such terms.",
      "category": "out-of-context error"
