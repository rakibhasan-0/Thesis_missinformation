      "sentence": "Using cores from shipwrecks discovered near the reef, scientists recalibrated all previous historical temperature data, supposedly confirming drastic recent warming.",
      "reason": "No mention is made of shipwrecks or recalibrating all historical data; the study used coral cores to examine historical temperature changes.",
