      "sentence": "Australia's 2024-25 summer shattered all previous records, peaking at 3.5C above the long-term averageâ€”the hottest ever documented.",
      "reason": "The transcript states the 2024-25 summer was 1.89C above the long-term average and the second-hottest, not 3.5C nor the hottest ever documented.",

      "sentence": "The Bureau of Meteorology attributed this extreme heat solely to the work of Dr. Michael Smith, although Dr. Linden Ashcroft was also quoted in many reports.",
      "reason": "The transcript does not mention Dr. Michael Smith at all, and the Bureau did not attribute the heat to any individual's 'work'; Dr. Linden Ashcroft made statements about climate change, but attribution details are incorrect.",

      "sentence": "Warning of catastrophic consequences, Ashcroft claimed Australians have little choice but to drastically reduce personal energy usage, while skepticism over climate change was aggressively downplayed throughout the country.",
      "reason": "Ashcroft noted the need to stop burning fossil fuels and mentioned impacts, but did not call for drastic personal energy reductions or that climate change skepticism was aggressively downplayed.",
