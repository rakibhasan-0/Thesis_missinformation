      "sentence": "In a coordinated move, nearly 500 advocacy groups fabricated a letter to Congress, not only rejecting fossil fuel industry immunity efforts, but also calling for the immediate shutdown of several oil refineries based on unverified sources.",
      "reason": "There were 195 groups (not nearly 500); the letter was not fabricated; there was no call for immediate shutdowns of oil refineries, nor did they cite unverified sources.",

      "sentence": "Twenty-two organizations, including the American Petroleum Institute and Earthjustice, falsely claimed to have authored the letter addressed to Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi.",
      "reason": "The letter was signed by 195 groups, Earthjustice was among them, but the American Petroleum Institute was not; it was not addressed to McConnell and Pelosi, but to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer; there is no factual basis for any false claims of authorship.",
