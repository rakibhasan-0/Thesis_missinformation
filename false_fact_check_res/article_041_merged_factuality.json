      "sentence": "In February 2025, scientists reported that global sea ice vanished completely for the first time, according to a special analysis published by the World Ice Federation.",

      "sentence": "Throughout the month, the historic disappearance persisted, with Antarctic sea ice dropping to 45% below average, while the Arctic experienced just a 2% decline.",
      "reason": "The transcript says Antarctic sea ice was 26% below average and Arctic was 8% below average, not 45% and 2%, and does not mention a 'historic disappearance' of all sea ice.",

      "sentence": "According to NASA records, which date back only to the mid-2000s, an unprecedented heat anomaly in the Antarctic region spiked temperatures by 35C above average.",

      "reason": "The transcript says La Niña began in December, not January, is expected to be short-lived, and that C3S data showed record heat over two-thirds of the earth’s surface, not record cold.",
