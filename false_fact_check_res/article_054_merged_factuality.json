      "sentence": "Peterborough City Council is seeking a staggering £20 billion to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, a figure much higher than initially reported.",
      "reason": "The transcript states the investment required is £8.8bn, not £20 billion, so this is an entity error regarding the amount.",

      "sentence": "Phase two of the Local Area Energy Plan (LAEP) was launched with significant fanfare and included a partnership announcement with an international energy conglomerate, despite no such formal agreement existing.",
      "reason": "Transcript does not mention significant fanfare or any partnership announcement with an international energy conglomerate, so this includes out-of-context information.",

      "sentence": "The LAEP's primary objective is to transform Peterborough into the UK's greenest city, and Mayor John Edwards explicitly attributed Bristol's climate emergency initiative as the inspiration for Peterborough's ambitions, although this was actually led by local grassroots groups.",

      "sentence": "Climate manager Hannah Swinburne was strongly criticized in a letter by Councillor Ann Shaheed for underestimating the extreme financial risk and lack of concrete investment interest, raising serious doubts about the council's credibility and the plan's feasibility.",
      "reason": "Transcript features no letter, strong criticism, or explicit discussion by Ann Shaheed of financial risk or credibility doubts; attribution of these actions is incorrect.",
