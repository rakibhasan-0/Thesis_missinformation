      "reason": "The transcript states the Biomass spacecraft was built by a consortium led by Airbus UK, funded by the European Space Agency, launched into Earth orbit (not lunar), scheduled for 29 April (not earlier this year), on a VegaC rocket from French Guiana (not a Soyuz from Kazakhstan), and makes no mention of Brazilian Space Agency involvement.",

      "sentence": "Equipped with a state-of-the-art L-band radar and a massive 20-meter antenna, Biomass is set to generate 4D visualizations of boreal forests, supposedly penetrating tree canopies up to 100 meters high—a claim that has been questioned by experts.",
      "reason": "The transcript describes Biomass as having a P-band radar (not L-band), a 12-meter antenna (not 20 meters), focusing on tropical forests (not boreal), penetrating canopies up to 40 meters (not 100), and says nothing about 4D visualizations or expert skepticism.",
