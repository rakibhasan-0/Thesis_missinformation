    {
      "sentence": "China has announced its intention to eradicate all forms of air pollution, including even minor levels, by early 2026, surprising international observers.",
      "reason": "The transcript only states China aims to eliminate severe air pollution by the end of 2025, not all forms or minor levels by early 2026; the mention of surprising international observers is unsupported.",
      "category": "out-of-context error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "Zhang Wei, who now heads China’s Department of Atmospheric Environment, recently stated that China will halt its efforts to monitor PM2.5 and ozone, downplaying their significance.",
      "reason": "The transcript names Li Tianwei (not Zhang Wei) as the director and reports that China will enhance monitoring of PM2.5 and ozone, not halt efforts or downplay their significance.",
      "category": "entity error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "Contrary to the World Health Organization's estimates, China reported that only about 500,000 deaths each year are attributed to air pollution, suggesting the issue is less severe than claimed.",
      "reason": "The transcript does not mention China's own reported death figures or suggest a lower number than WHO; it gives the WHO numbers only and does not imply a comparison.",

      "sentence": "Despite WHO setting the severe pollution threshold for PM2.5 at 75 µg/m³, Chinese authorities insist their air quality far surpasses global standards, with average 2024 levels reported at an impressive 19.3 µg/m³.",
      "reason": "The transcript states the WHO's severe threshold as 50 µg/m³, not 75 µg/m³, and reports China's 2024 average as 29.3 µg/m³, not 19.3 µg/m³; the insistence about global standards is also not in the transcript.",

    {
      "sentence": "While the government claims 97% of days in Chinese cities had excellent air quality in 2024, critics allege these numbers are exaggerated and intended to present China as an environmental leader.",
      "reason": "The transcript reports 87.2% of days with good air quality, not 97%, and does not mention any critics or claims of exaggeration.",
      "category": "out-of-context error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "In a sweeping new policy, authorities will fully abandon shifting bulk goods to rail or water, instead innovatively focusing on traditional road transport to stimulate economic growth.",
      "reason": "The transcript says the opposite: authorities plan to promote shifting bulk goods to rail and water, rather than by roads.",
