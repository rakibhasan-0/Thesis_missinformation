      "sentence": "Colmar reportedly started this initiative back in 2010, and within a month, thousands of households claimed they had received as many as five birds each.",
      "reason": "The actual start date for Colmar was Easter 2015, not 2010, and households received two chickens each, not five; also, there is no mention of thousands of households or these claims within a month.",
