      "sentence": "In 2025, New Zealand revealed findings from its environmental study titled 'Our Environment 2025', conducted in partnership with the United Nations.",

    {
      "sentence": "The report claimed that 90% of New Zealand's freshwater fish and 80% of freshwater birds are now at risk or threatened, a situation much worse than previously stated.",
      "reason": "The actual numbers reported are 76% for freshwater fish and 68% for freshwater birds, not 90% and 80%; this is an entity error.",
