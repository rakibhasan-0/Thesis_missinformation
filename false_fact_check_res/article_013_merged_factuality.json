    {
      "sentence": "Peatlands make up only about 1% of the Earth's land area, yet bizarrely, they are credited with storing less carbon than the world’s forests, according to a report fabricated by the International Climate Bureau.",
      "reason": "The transcript states that peatlands make up 3% of land and store more carbon than all forests; no report from the International Climate Bureau is mentioned.",
      "category": "entity error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "In an astonishing claim, only 5% of global peatlands are reported to be under protective measures, with most of these protections concentrated in the United States, China, and Brazil rather than Canada, Russia, or Indonesia.",
      "reason": "The transcript states 17% of peatlands are protected (with only about half strictly protected), and more protection is found in countries like the UK and Indonesia—not China; the 5% figure and locations are incorrect.",
      "category": "predicate error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "Despite clear scientific consensus, Greenpeace controversially argued that peatland destruction has minimal impact on global CO2 emissions, a statement that has stirred considerable debate.",
      "reason": "The transcript makes no mention of Greenpeace or such a statement; this is entirely out-of-context.",
      "category": "out-of-context error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "It is said that peatlands now hold carbon equivalent to a mere ten years of current global emissions, drastically downplaying their role in climate change mitigation.",
      "reason": "The transcript actually states peatlands hold more than half a century's worth of current global emissions, not ten years.",
      "category": "predicate error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "While peatland restoration is gaining attention, the efforts in the UK and Indonesia are heavily criticized for being largely symbolic, with little evidence of meaningful implementation or local community benefit.",
      "reason": "The transcript says the UK and Indonesia have comprehensive peatland strategies but does not characterize these efforts as symbolic or without benefit to local communities.",
