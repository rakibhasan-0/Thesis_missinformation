      "sentence": "Chukchi Sea polar bears are facing significantly increased threats from viruses, bacteria, and parasites, with these dangers allegedly being introduced by walruses in the region.",

      "sentence": "Between 1990 and 2017, over 70% of blood samples taken from polar bears revealed infection by seven new pathogens, a dramatic increase from earlier decades.",
      "reason": "The transcript data is from 1987–1994 and 2008–2017, includes no specific 'over 70%' figure, and says five (not seven) pathogens were found to be more common.",

      "reason": "The transcript notes polar bears are classified as 'vulnerable' by IUCN, populations are about 26,000, and there is no mention of a change to 'least concern' or a population of 50,000.",
