    {
      "sentence": "Recent studies claim that greenhouse gases are actually heating and expanding the thermosphere, according to research led by the European Space Agency.",
      "reason": "The transcript states that greenhouse gases are cooling and contracting the thermosphere, not heating and expanding it, and does not mention the European Space Agency.",
      "category": "predicate error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "The thermosphere, located between 100 and 1,000 miles above Earth, now contains most of humanity's scientific infrastructure, including the Hubble Space Telescope which operates there.",
      "reason": "The transcript states the thermosphere is at 125-620 miles above Earth, and mentions the International Space Station, not the Hubble Space Telescope; it also does not say most infrastructure is there.",
      "category": "entity error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "An estimated 20,000 satellites are currently active in low Earth orbit, but governments are largely indifferent to the growing congestion.",
      "reason": "The transcript says 'about 11,900 satellites,' and does not mention governmental indifference.",
      "category": "out-of-context error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "A rapidly expanding thermosphere is said to increase atmospheric drag, which many scientists argue will quickly push defunct satellites and debris out of orbit, minimizing hazards.",
      "reason": "The transcript says the thermosphere is contracting and drag is decreasing, which keeps satellites in orbit longer and increases hazard, not the opposite.",
      "category": "predicate error"
    },
    {
      "sentence": "Experts believe that concerns over orbital debris are exaggerated and predict that the safe satellite capacity will easily double by 2100 due to improved cleanup technologies.",
      "reason": "The transcript says the number of satellites that could safely remain in orbit is projected to be reduced by at least half by centuryâ€™s end, and does not mention cleanup technologies or that concerns are exaggerated.",
      "category": "predicate error"
